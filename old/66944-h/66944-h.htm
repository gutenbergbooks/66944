  <h2 id='art1' class='c003'>HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Lord Kelvin writing in 1893, in his preface to the
English edition of Hertz’s Researches on Electric Waves,
says “many workers and many thinkers have helped to
build up the nineteenth century school of <i>plenum</i>, one
ether for light, heat, electricity, magnetism; and the
German and English volumes containing Hertz’s electrical
papers, given to the world in the last decade of the
century, will be a permanent monument of the splendid
consummation now realised.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ten years later, in 1905, we find Einstein declaring
that “the ether will be proved to be superfluous.” At
first sight the revolution in scientific thought brought
about in the course of a single decade appears to be almost
too violent. A more careful even though a rapid review
of the subject will, however, show how the Theory of
Relativity gradually became a historical necessity.</p>

<p class='c005'>Towards the beginning of the nineteenth century,
the luminiferous ether came into prominence as a result of
the brilliant successes of the wave theory in the hands
of Young and Fresnel. In its stationary aspect the
elastic solid ether was the outcome of the search for a
medium in which the light waves may “undulate.” This
stationary ether, as shown by Young, also afforded a
satisfactory explanation of astronomical aberration. But
its very success gave rise to a host of new questions all
bearing on the central problem of relative motion of ether
and matter.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Arago’s prism experiment.</i>—The refractive index of a
glass prism depends on the incident velocity of light
outside the prism and its velocity inside the prism after
refraction. On Fresnel’s fixed ether hypothesis, the
incident light waves are situated in the stationary ether
outside the prism and move with velocity <i>c</i> with respect
to the ether. If the prism moves with a velocity <i>u</i>
with respect to this fixed ether, then the incident velocity
of light with respect to the prism should be <i>c</i> + <i>u</i>. Thus
the refractive index of the glass prism should depend on <i>u</i>
the absolute velocity of the prism, <i>i.e.</i>, its velocity with
respect to the fixed ether. Arago performed the experiment
in 1819, but failed to detect the expected change.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Airy-Boscovitch water-telescope experiment.</i>—Boscovitch
had still earlier in 1766, raised the very important
question of the dependence of aberration on the refractive
index of the medium filling the telescope. Aberration
depends on the difference in the velocity of light outside
the telescope and its velocity inside the telescope. If the
latter velocity changes owing to a change in the medium
filling the telescope, aberration itself should change, that
is, aberration should depend on the nature of the medium.</p>

<p class='c005'>Airy, in 1871 filled up a telescope with water—but
failed to detect any change in the aberration. Thus we
get both in the case of Arago prism experiment and
Airy-Boscovitch water-telescope experiment, the very
startling result that optical effects in a moving medium
seem to be quite independent of the velocity of the
medium with respect to Fresnel’s stationary ether.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Fresnel’s convection coefficient k = 1 - 1/μ<sup>2</sup>.</i>—Possibly
some form of compensation is taking place. Working on
this hypothesis, Fresnel offered his famous ether convection
theory. According to Fresnel, the presence of matter
implies a definite condensation of ether within the
region occupied by matter. This “condensed” or
excess portion of ether is supposed to be carried away
with its own piece of moving matter. It should be
observed that only the “excess” portion is carried away,
while the rest remains as stagnant as ever. A complete
convection of the “excess” ether ρ′ with the full velocity
<i>u</i> is optically equivalent to a partial convection of the
total ether ρ, with only a fraction of the velocity <i>k</i>. <i>u</i>.
Fresnel showed that if this convection coefficient <i>k</i> is
1 - 1/μ<sup>2</sup> (μ being the refractive index of the prism), then
the velocity of light after refraction within the moving
prism would be altered to just such extent as would make
the refractive index of the moving prism quite independent
of its “absolute” velocity <i>u</i>. The non-dependence
of aberration on the “absolute” velocity <i>u</i>, is also very
easily explained with the help of this Fresnelian convection-coefficient
<i>k</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Stokes’ viscous ether.</i>—It should be remembered, however,
that Fresnel’s stationary ether is absolutely fixed and is not
at all disturbed by the motion of matter through it. In this
respect Fresnelian ether cannot be said to behave in any
respectable physical fashion, and this led Stokes, in
1845-46, to construct a more material type of medium.
Stokes assumed that viscous motion ensues near the surface
of separation of ether and moving matter, while at
sufficiently distant regions the ether remains wholly
undisturbed. He showed how such a viscous ether would
explain aberration if all motion in it were differentially
irrotational. But in order to explain the null Arago
effect, Stokes was compelled to assume the convection
hypothesis of Fresnel with an identical numerical value
for <i>k</i>, namely 1 - 1/μ<sup>2</sup>. Thus the prestige of the Fresnelian
convection-coefficient was enhanced, if anything, by the
theoretical investigations of Stokes.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Fizeau’s experiment.</i>—Soon after, in 1851, it received
direct experimental confirmation in a brilliant piece of
work by Fizeau.</p>

<p class='c005'>If a divided beam of light is re-united after passing
through two adjacent cylinders filled with water, ordinary
interference fringes will be produced. If the water in one
of the cylinders is now made to flow, the “condensed”
ether within the flowing water would be convected and
would produce a shift in the interference fringes. The
shift actually observed agreed very well with a value of
k = 1 - 1/μ<sup>2</sup>. The Fresnelian convection-coefficient now
became firmly established as a consequence of a direct
positive effect. On the other hand, the negative evidences
in favour of the convection-coefficient had also multiplied.
Mascart, Hoek, Maxwell and others sought for definite
changes in different optical effects induced by the motion
of the earth relative to the stationary ether. But all such
attempts failed to reveal the slightest trace of any optical
disturbance due to the “absolute” velocity of the earth,
thus proving conclusively that all the different optical
effects shared in the general compensation arising out of
the Fresnelian convection of the excess ether. It must be
carefully noted that the Fresnelian convection-coefficient
implicitly assumes the existence of a fixed ether (Fresnel) or
at least a wholly stagnant medium at sufficiently distant
regions (Stokes), with reference to which alone a convection
velocity can have any significance. Thus the convection-coefficient
implying some type of a stationary or viscous,
yet nevertheless “absolute” ether, succeeded in explaining
satisfactorily all known optical facts down to 1880.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Michelson-Morley Experiment.</i>—In 1881, Michelson
and Morley performed their classical experiments which
undermined the whole structure of the old ether theory
and thus served to introduce the new theory of relativity.
The fundamental idea underlying this experiment is quite
simple. In all old experiments the velocity of light
situated in free ether was compared with the velocity
of waves actually situated in a piece of moving matter
and presumably carried away by it. The compensatory
effect of the Fresnelian convection of ether afforded a
satisfactory explanation of all negative results.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the Michelson-Morley experiment the arrangement is
quite different. If there is a definite gap in a rigid body,
light waves situated in free ether will take a definite time
in crossing the gap. If the rigid platform carrying the
gap is set in motion with respect to the ether in the direction
of light propagation, light waves (which are even now
situated in free ether) should presumably take a longer
time to cross the gap.</p>

<p class='c005'>We cannot do better than quote Eddington’s description
of this famous experiment. “The principle of the
experiment may be illustrated by considering a swimmer in
a river. It is easily realized that it takes longer to swim
to a point 50 yards up-stream and back than to a point 50
yards across-stream and back. If the earth is moving
through the ether there is a river of ether flowing through
the laboratory, and a wave of light may be compared to a
swimmer travelling with constant velocity relative to the
current. If, then, we divide a beam of light into two parts,
and send one-half swimming up the stream for a certain
distance and then (by a mirror) back to the starting
point, and send the other half an equal distance across
stream and back, the across-stream beam should arrive
back first.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/fig01.png' alt='Experiment.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>Let the ether be flowing relative to
the apparatus with velocity <i>u</i> in the
direction O<i>x</i>, and let OA, OB, be
the two arms of the apparatus of equal
length <i>l</i>, OA being placed up-stream. Let <i>c</i> be the
velocity of light. The time for the double journey along
OA and back is</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/form-001.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>where</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/form-002.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>a factor greater than unity.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the transverse journey the light must have a component
velocity <i>n</i> up-stream (relative to the ether) in order to
avoid being carried below OB: and since its total velocity
is <i>c</i>, its component across-stream must be √(<i>c²</i> - <i>u²</i>), the
time for the double journey OB is accordingly</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/form-003.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>so that <i>t₁</i> > <i>t₂</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>But when the experiment was tried, it was found that
both parts of the beam took the same time, as tested by
the interference bands produced.”</p>

<p class='c005'>After a most careful series of observations, Michelson
and Morley failed to detect the slightest trace of any
effect due to earth’s motion through ether.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Michelson-Morley experiment seems to show that
there is no relative motion of ether and matter. Fresnel’s
stagnant ether requires a relative velocity of—<i>u</i>. Thus
Michelson and Morley themselves thought at first that their
experiment confirmed Stokes’ viscous ether, in which no
relative motion can ensue on account of the absence of
slipping of ether at the surface of separation. But even
on Stokes’ theory this viscous flow of ether would fall
off at a very rapid rate as we recede from the surface
of separation. Michelson and Morley repeated their experiment
at different heights from the surface of the earth, but
invariably obtained the same negative results, thus failing
to confirm Stokes’ theory of viscous flow.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Lodge’s experiment.</i>—Further, in 1893, Lodge performed
his rotating sphere experiment which showed
complete absence of any viscous flow of ether due to
moving masses of matter. A divided beam of light, after
repeated reflections within a very narrow gap between two
massive hemispheres, was allowed to re-unite and thus
produce interference bands. When the two hemispheres
are set rotating, it is conceivable that the ether in the gap
would be disturbed due to viscous flow, and any such flow
would be immediately detected by a disturbance of the
interference bands. But actual observation failed to
detect the slightest disturbance of the ether in the gap,
due to the motion of the hemispheres. Lodge’s experiment
thus seems to show a complete absence of any viscous
flow of ether.</p>

<p class='c005'>Apart from these experimental discrepancies, grave
theoretical objections were urged against a viscous ether.
Stokes himself had shown that his ether must be incompressible
and all motion in it differentially irrotational,
at the same time there should be absolutely no slipping at
the surface of separation. Now all these conditions cannot
be simultaneously satisfied for any conceivable material
medium without certain very special and arbitrary assumptions.
Thus Stokes’ ether failed to satisfy the very motive
which had led Stokes to formulate it, namely, the desirability
of constructing a “physical” medium. Planck offered
modified forms of Stokes’ theory which seemed capable of
being reconciled with the Michelson-Morley experiment,
but required very special assumptions. The very complexity
and the very arbitrariness of these assumptions prevented
Planck’s ether from attaining any degree of practical
importance in the further development of the subject.</p>

<p class='c005'>The sole criterion of the value of any scientific theory
must ultimately be its capacity for offering a simple,
unified, coherent and fruitful description of observed facts.
In proportion as a theory becomes complex it loses in
usefulness—a theory which is obliged to requisition a
whole array of arbitrary assumptions in order to explain
special facts is practically worse than useless, as it serves
to disjoin, rather than to unite, the several groups of facts.
The optical experiments of the last quarter of the nineteenth
century showed the impossibility of constructing a
simple ether theory, which would be amenable to analytic
treatment and would at the same time stimulate further
progress. It should be observed that it could scarcely be
shown that no logically consistent ether theory was
possible; indeed in 1910, H. A. Wilson offered a consistent
ether theory which was at least quite neutral with
respect to all available optical data. But Wilson’s ether
is almost wholly negative—its only virtue being that it
does not directly contradict observed facts. Neither any
direct confirmation nor a direct refutation is possible and
it does not throw any light on the various optical phenomena.
A theory like this being practically useless stands
self-condemned.</p>

<p class='c005'>We must now consider the problem of relative motion of
ether and matter from the point of view of electrical theory.
From 1860 the identity of light as an electromagnetic
vector became gradually established as a result of the
brilliant “displacement current” hypothesis of Clerk
Maxwell and his further analytical investigations. The
elastic solid ether became gradually transformed into the
electromagnetic one. Maxwell succeeded in giving a fairly
satisfactory account of all ordinary optical phenomena
and little room was left for any serious doubts as regards
the general validity of Maxwell’s theory. Hertz’s researches
on electric waves, first carried out in 1886,
succeeded in furnishing a strong experimental confirmation
of Maxwell’s theory. Electric waves behaved generally
like light waves of very large wave length.</p>

<p class='c005'>The orthodox Maxwellian view located the dielectric
polarisation in the electromagnetic ether which was merely
a transformation of Fresnel’s stagnant ether. The magnetic
polarisation was looked upon as wholly secondary in
origin, being due to the relative motion of the dielectric
tubes of polarisation. On this view the Fresnelian convection
coefficient comes out to be ½, as shown by J. J.
Thomson in 1880, instead of 1 - (1/μ²) as required by
optical experiments. This obviously implies a complete
failure to account for all those optical experiments which
depend for their satisfactory explanation on the assumption
of a value for the convection coefficient equal to 1 - (1/μ²).</p>

<p class='c005'>The modifications proposed independently by Hertz and
Heaviside fare no better.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c007'><sup>[1]</sup></a> They postulated the actual
medium to be the seat of all electric polarisation and further
emphasised the reciprocal relation subsisting between
electricity and magnetism, thus making the field equations
more symmetrical. On this view the whole of the
polarised ether is carried away by the moving medium,
and consequently, the convection coefficient naturally
becomes unity in this theory, a value quite as discrepant
as that obtained on the original Maxwellian assumption.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus neither Maxwell’s original theory nor its subsequent
modifications as developed by Hertz and Heaviside
succeeded in obtaining a value for Fresnelian coefficient
equal to 1 - (1/μ<sup>2</sup>), and consequently stood totally condemned
from the optical point of view.</p>

<p class='c005'>Certain direct electromagnetic experiments involving
relative motion of polarised dielectrics were no less conclusive
against the generalised theory of Hertz and Heaviside.
According to Hertz a moving dielectric would carry away
the whole of its electric displacement with it. Hence the
electromagnetic effect near the moving dielectric would
be proportional to the total electric displacement, that is
to K, the specific inductive capacity of the dielectric. In
1901, Blondlot working with a stream of moving gas
could not detect any such effect. H. A. Wilson repeated
the experiment in an improved form in 1903 and working
with ebonite found that the observed effect was proportional
to K - 1 instead of to K. For gases K is nearly
equal to 1 and hence practically no effect will be observed
in their case. This gives a satisfactory explanation of
Blondlot’s negative results.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rowland had shown in 1876 that the magnetic force
due to a rotating condenser (the dielectric remaining
stationary) was proportional to K, the sp. ind. cap. On
the other hand, Röntgen found in 1888 the magnetic
effect due to a rotating dielectric (the condenser remaining
stationary) to be proportional to K - 1, and not to
K. Finally Eichenwald in 1903 found that when both
condenser and dielectric are rotated together, the effect
observed was quite independent of K, a result quite
consistent with the two previous experiments. The Rowland
effect proportional to K, together with the opposite
Röntgen effect proportional to 1 - K, makes the Eichenwald
effect independent of K.</p>

<p class='c005'>All these experiments together with those of Blondlot
and Wilson made it clear that the electromagnetic
effect due to a moving dielectric was proportional to
K - 1, and not to K as required by Hertz’s theory. Thus
the above group of experiments with moving dielectrics
directly contradicted the Hertz-Heaviside theory. The
internal discrepancies inherent in the classic ether theory
had now become too prominent. It was clear that the
ether concept had finally outgrown its usefulness. The
observed facts had become too contradictory and too
heterogeneous to be reduced to an organised whole with
the help of the ether concept alone. Radical departures
from the classical theory had become absolutely necessary.</p>

<p class='c005'>There were several outstanding difficulties in connection
with anomalous dispersion, selective reflection and
selective absorption which could not be satisfactory
explained in the classic electromagnetic theory. It
was evident that the assumption of some kind of
discreteness in the optical medium had become inevitable.
Such an assumption naturally gave rise to an
atomic theory of electricity, namely, the modern electron
theory. Lorentz had postulated the existence of electrons
so early as 1878, but it was not until some years later that
the electron theory became firmly established on a satisfactory
basis.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lorentz assumed that a moving dielectric merely carried
away its own “polarisation doublets,” which on his theory
gave rise to the induced field proportional to K - 1. The
field near a moving dielectric is naturally proportional to
K - 1 and not to K. Lorentz’s theory thus gave a
satisfactory explanation of all those experiments with
moving dielectrics which required effects proportional to
K - 1. Lorentz further succeeded in obtaining a value for
the Fresnelian convection coefficient equal to 1 - 1/μ<sup>2</sup>, the
exact value required by all optical experiments of the
moving type.</p>

<p class='c005'>We must now go back to Michelson and Morley’s
experiment. We have seen that both parts of the beam
are situated in free ether; no material medium is involved
in any portion of the paths actually traversed by the beam.
Consequently no compensation due to Fresnelian convection
of ether by moving medium is possible. Thus Fresnelian
convection compensation can have no possible application
in this case. Yet some marvellous compensation has
evidently taken place which has completely masked the
“absolute” velocity of the earth.</p>

<p class='c005'>In Michelson and Morley’s experiment, the distance
travelled by the beam along OA (that is, in a direction
parallel to the motion of the platform) is 2<i>l</i>β², while the
distance travelled by the beam along OB, perpendicular to
the direction of motion of the platform, is 2<i>l</i>β. Yet the
most careful experiments showed, as Eddington says, “that
both parts of the beam took the same time as tested by the
interference bands produced. It would seem that OA and
OB could not really have been of the same length; and if
OB was of length <i>l</i>, OA must have been of length <i>l</i>/β. The
apparatus was now rotated through 90°, so that OB became
the up-stream. The time for the two journeys was again
the same, so that 0B must now be the shorter length. The
plain meaning of the experiment is that both arms have a
length <i>l</i> when placed along O<i>y</i> (perpendicular to the direction
of motion), and automatically contract to a length
<i>l</i>/β, when placed along O<i>x</i> (parallel to the direction of
motion). This explanation was first given by Fitz-Gerald.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This Fitz-Gerald contraction, startling enough in
itself, does not suffice. Assuming this contraction to be a
real one, the distance travelled with respect to the ether is
2<i>l</i>β and the time taken for this journey is 2<i>l</i>β/<i>c</i>. But the
distance travelled with respect to the platform is always
2<i>l</i>. Hence the velocity of light with respect to the platform
is</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/form-004.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>a variable quantity depending on
the “absolute” velocity of the platform. But no trace
of such an effect has ever been found. The velocity of
light is always found to be quite independent of the velocity
of the platform. The present difficulty cannot be solved
by any further alteration in the measure of space. The
only recourse left open is to alter the measure of time as
well, that is, to adopt the concept of “local time.” If a moving
clock goes slower so that one ‘real’ second becomes 1/β
second as measured in the moving system, the velocity of
light relative to the platform will always remain <i>c</i>. We
must adopt two very startling hypotheses, namely, the
Fitz-Gerald contraction and the concept of “local time,”
in order to give a satisfactory explanation of the
Michelson-Morley experiment.</p>

<p class='c005'>These results were already reached by Lorentz in the
course of further developments of his electron theory.
Lorentz used a special set of transformation equations<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c007'><sup>[2]</sup></a> for
time which implicitly introduced the concept of local time.
But he himself failed to attach any special significance to
it, and looked upon it rather as a mere mathematical
artifice like imaginary quantities in analysis or the circle
at infinity in projective geometry. The originality of
Einstein at this stage consists in his successful physical
interpretation of these results, and viewing them as the
coherent organised consequences of a single general
principle. Lorentz established the Relativity Theorem<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c007'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
(consisting merely of a set of transformation equations)
while Einstein generalised it into a Universal Principle. In
addition Einstein introduced fundamentally new concepts
of space and time, which served to destroy old fetishes and
demanded a wholesale revision of scientific concepts and
thus opened up new possibilities in the synthetic unification
of natural processes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Newton had framed his laws of motion in such a way
as to make them quite independent of the absolute velocity
of the earth. Uniform relative motion of ether and matter
could not be detected with the help of dynamical laws.
According to Einstein neither could it be detected with the
help of optical or electromagnetic experiments. Thus the
Einsteinian Principle of Relativity asserts that all physical
laws are independent of the ‘absolute’ velocity of an observer.</p>

<p class='c005'>For different systems, the <i>form</i> of all physical laws is
conserved. If we chose the velocity of light<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c007'><sup>[4]</sup></a> to be the
fundamental unit of measurement for all observers (that is,
assume the constancy of the velocity of light in all systems)
we can establish a <i>metric</i> “one-one” correspondence
between any two observed systems, such correspondence
depending only the <i>relative</i> velocity of the two systems.
Einstein’s Relativity is thus merely the consistent logical
application of the well known physical principle that we
can know nothing but <i>relative</i> motion. In this sense it is
a further extension of Newtonian Relativity.</p>

<p class='c005'>On this interpretation, the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction
and “local time” lose their arbitrary character. Space
and time as measured by two different observers are naturally
diverse, and the difference depends only on their relative
motion. Both are equally valid; they are merely different
descriptions of the same physical reality. This is essentially
the point of view adopted by Minkowski. He considers time
itself to be one of the co-ordinate axes, and in his four-dimensional
world, that is in the space-time reality, relative
motion is reduced to a rotation of the axes of reference.
Thus, the diversity in the measurement of lengths and
temporal rates is merely due to the static difference in the
“frame-work” of the different observers.</p>

<p class='c005'>The above theory of Relativity absorbed practically
the whole of the electromagnetic theory based on the
Maxwell-Lorentz system of field equations. It combined
all the advantages of classic Maxwellian theory together
with an electronic hypothesis. The Lorentz assumption of
polarisation doublets had furnished a satisfactory explanation
of the Fresnelian convection of ether, but in the new
theory this is deduced merely as a consequence of the altered
concept of relative velocity. In addition, the theory of
Relativity accepted the results of Michelson and Morley’s
experiments as a definite principle, namely, the principle of
the constancy of the velocity of light, so that there was
nothing left for explanation in the Michelson-Morley
experiment. But even more than all this, it established a
single general principle which served to connect together
in a simple coherent and fruitful manner the known facts
of Physics.</p>

<p class='c005'>The theory of Relativity received direct experimental
confirmation in several directions. Repeated attempts were
made to detect the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction. Any
ordinary physical contraction will usually have observable
physical results; for example, the total electrical resistance
of a conductor will diminish. Trouton and Noble, Trouton
and Rankine, Rayleigh and Brace, and others employed
a variety of different methods to detect the Lorentz-Fitzgerald
contraction, but invariably with the same
negative results. <i>Whether there is an ether or not,
uniform velocity with respect to it can never be detected.</i>
This does not prove that there is no such thing as an
ether but certainly does render the ether entirely superfluous.
Universal compensation is due to a change in local
units of length and time, or rather, being merely different
descriptions of the same reality, there is no compensation
at all.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was another group of observed phenomena which
could scarcely be fitted into a Newtonian scheme of
dynamics without doing violence to it. The experimental
work of Kaufmann, in 1901, made it abundantly clear that
the “mass” of an electron depended on its velocity. So
early as 1881, J. J. Thomson had shown that the inertia of
a charged particle increased with its velocity. Abraham
now deduced a formula for the variation of mass with
velocity, on the hypothesis that an electron always remained
a <i>rigid</i> sphere. Lorentz proceeded on the assumption
that the electron shared in the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction
and obtained a totally different formula. A very
careful series of measurements carried out independently by
Bücherer, Wolz, Hupka and finally Neumann in 1913,
decided conclusively in favour of the Lorentz formula.
This “contractile” formula follows immediately as a direct
consequence of the new Theory of Relativity, without any
assumption as regards the electrical origin of inertia. Thus
the complete agreement of experimental facts with the
predictions of the new theory must be considered as
confirming it as a principle which goes even beyond the
electron itself. The greatest triumph of this new theory
consists, indeed, in the fact that a large number of results,
which had formerly required all kinds of special hypotheses
for their explanation, are now deduced very simply as
inevitable consequences of one single general principle.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have now traced the history of the development of
the restricted or special theory of Relativity, which is
mainly concerned with optical and electrical phenomena.
It was first offered by Einstein in 1905. Ten years later,
Einstein formulated his second theory, the Generalised
Principle of Relativity. This new theory is mainly a theory
of gravitation and has very little connection with optics
and electricity. In one sense, the second theory is indeed
a further generalisation of the restricted principle, but the
former does not really contain the latter as a special case.</p>

<p class='c005'>Einstein’s first theory is restricted in the sense that it
only refers to uniform rectilinear motion and has no application
to any kind of accelerated movements. Einstein in
his second theory extends the Relativity Principle to cases
of accelerated motion. If Relativity is to be universally
true, then even accelerated motion must be merely <i>relative
motion between matter and matter</i>. Hence the Generalised
Principle of Relativity asserts that “absolute” motion
cannot be detected even with the help of gravitational laws.</p>

<p class='c005'>All movements must be referred to definite sets of
co-ordinate axes. If there is any change of axes, the
numerical magnitude of the movements will also change.
But according to Newtonian dynamics, such alteration in
physical movements can only be due to the effect of certain
forces in the field.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c007'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Thus any change of axes will introduce
new “geometrical” forces in the field which are quite
independent of the nature of the body acted on. Gravitational
forces also have this same remarkable property, and
gravitation itself may be of essentially the same nature as
these “geometrical” forces introduced by a change of axes.
This leads to Einstein’s famous Principle of Equivalence.
<i>A gravitational field of force is strictly equivalent to one
introduced by a transformation of co-ordinates and no possible
experiment can distinguish between the two.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>Thus it may become possible to “transform away”
gravitational effects, at least for sufficiently small regions of
space, by referring all movements to a new set of axes. This
new “framework” may of course have all kinds of very
complicated movements when referred to the old Galilean
or “rectangular unaccelerated system of co-ordinates.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But there is no reason why we should look upon the
Galilean system as more fundamental than any other. If it
is found simpler to refer all motion in a gravitational field
to a special set of co-ordinates, we may certainly look upon
this special “framework” (at least for the particular region
concerned), to be more fundamental and more natural. We
may, still more simply, identify this particular framework
with the special local properties of space in that region.
That is, we can look upon the effects of a gravitational
field as simply due to the local properties of space and time
itself. The very presence of matter implies a modification
of the characteristics of space and time in its neighbourhood.
As Eddington says “matter does not cause the
curvature of space-time. It is the curvature. Just as
light does not cause electromagnetic oscillations; it is the
oscillations.”</p>

<p class='c005'>We may look upon this from a slightly different point
of view. The General Principle of Relativity asserts that
all motion is merely relative motion between matter and
matter, and as all movements must be referred to definite
sets of co-ordinates, the ground of any possible framework
must ultimately be material in character. It <i>is</i> convenient
to take the matter actually present in a field as the
fundamental ground of our framework. If this is done,
the special characteristics of our framework would naturally
depend on the actual distribution of matter in the field.
But physical space and time is completely defined by the
“framework.” In other words the “framework” itself <i>is</i>
space and time. Hence we see how <i>physical</i> space and time
is actually defined by the local distribution of matter.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are certain magnitudes which remain constant by
any change of axes. In ordinary geometry distance
between two points is one such magnitude; so that
δ<i>x²</i> + δ<i>y²</i> + δ<i>z²</i> is an invariant. In the restricted theory of
light, the principle of constancy of light velocity demands
that δ<i>x²</i> + δ<i>y²</i> + δ<i>z²</i> - <i>c²</i>δ<i>t²</i> should remain constant.</p>

<p class='c005'>The <i>separation ds</i> of adjacent events is defined by
<i>ds²</i> = -<i>dx²</i> - <i>dy²</i> - <i>dz²</i> + <i>c²dt²</i>. It is an extension of the
notion of distance and this is the new invariant. Now if
<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i> are transformed to any set of new variables
<i>x₁</i>, <i>x₂</i>, <i>x₃</i>, <i>x₄</i>, we shall get a quadratic expression for</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/form-005.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>where the <i>g</i>’s are
functions of <i>x₁</i>, <i>x₂</i>, <i>x₃</i>, <i>x₄</i> depending on the transformation.</p>

<p class='c005'>The special properties of space and time in any region
are defined by these <i>g</i>’s which are themselves determined
by the actual distribution of matter in the locality. Thus
from the Newtonian point of view, these <i>g</i>’s represent the
gravitational effect of matter while from the Relativity
stand-point, these merely define the non-Newtonian (and
incidentally non-Euclidean) space in the neighbourhood of
matter.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have seen that Einstein’s theory requires local
curvature of space-time in the neighbourhood of matter.
Such altered characteristics of space and time give a
satisfactory explanation of an outstanding discrepancy in
the observed advance of perihelion of Mercury. The large
discordance is almost completely removed by Einstein’s
theory.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again, in an intense gravitational field, a beam of light
will be affected by the local curvature of space, so that to
an observer who is referring all phenomena to a Newtonian
system, the beam of light will appear to deviate from its
path along an Euclidean straight line.</p>

<p class='c005'>This famous prediction of Einstein about the deflection
of a beam of light by the sun’s gravitational field was
tested during the total solar eclipse of May, 1919. The
observed deflection is decisively in favour of the Generalised
Theory of Relativity.</p>

<p class='c005'>It should be noted however that the velocity of light
itself would decrease in a gravitational field. This may
appear at first sight to be a violation of the principle of
constancy of light-velocity. But when we remember that
the Special Theory is explicitly <i>restricted</i> to the case of
unaccelerated motion, the difficulty vanishes. In the
absence of a gravitational field, that is in any unaccelerated
system, the velocity of light will always remain constant.
Thus the validity of the Special Theory is completely
preserved within its own <i>restricted</i> field.</p>

<p class='c005'>Einstein has proposed a third crucial test. He has
predicted a shift of spectral lines towards the red, due to an
intense gravitational potential. Experimental difficulties
are very considerable here, as the shift of spectral lines is a
complex phenomenon. Evidence is conflicting and nothing
conclusive can yet be asserted. Einstein thought that a
gravitational displacement of the Fraunhofer lines is a
necessary and fundamental condition for the acceptance of
his theory. But Eddington has pointed out that even if
this test fails, the logical conclusion would seem to be that
while Einstein’s law of gravitation is true for matter in
bulk, it is not true for such small material systems as
atomic oscillator.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>Conclusion</h3>
<p class='c004'>From the conceptual stand-point there are several
important consequences of the Generalised or Gravitational
Theory of Relativity. Physical space-time is perceived to
be intimately connected with the actual local distribution
of matter. Euclid-Newtonian space-time is <i>not</i> the actual
space-time of Physics, simply because the former completely
neglects the actual presence of matter. Euclid-Newtonian
continuum is merely an abstraction, while physical space-*time
is the actual framework which has some definite
curvature due to the presence of matter. Gravitational
Theory of Relativity thus brings out clearly the fundamental
distinction between actual physical space-time
(which is non-isotropic and non-Euclid-Newtonian) on one
hand and the abstract Euclid-Newtonian continuum (which
is homogeneous, isotropic and a purely intellectual construction)
on the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>The measurements of the rotation of the earth reveals a
fundamental framework which may be called the “inertial
framework.” This constitutes the actual physical universe.
This universe approaches Galilean space-time at a great
distance from matter.</p>

<p class='c005'>The properties of this physical universe may be referred
to some world-distribution of matter or the “inertial framework”
may be constructed by a suitable modification of the
law of gravitation itself. In Einstein’s theory the actual
curvature of the “inertial framework” is referred to vast
quantities of undetected world-matter. It has interesting
consequences. The dimensions of Einsteinian universe
would depend on the quantity of matter in it; it would
vanish to a point in the total absence of matter. Then
again curvature depends on the quantity of matter, and
hence in the presence of a sufficient quantity of matter space-time
may curve round and close up. Einsteinian universe
will then reduce to a finite system without boundaries, like
the surface of a sphere. In this “closed up” system,
light rays will come to a focus after travelling round the
universe and we should see an “anti-sun” (corresponding to
the back surface of the sun) at a point in the sky opposite
to the real sun. This anti-sun would of course be equally
large and equally bright if there is no absorption of light
in free space.</p>

<p class='c005'>In de Sitter’s theory, the existence of vast quantities of
world-matter is not required. But beyond a definite
distance from an observer, time itself stands still, so that
to the observer nothing can ever “happen” there. All
these theories are still highly speculative in character, but
they have certainly extended the scope of theoretical physics
to the central problem of the ultimate nature of the
universe itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>One outstanding peculiarity still attaches to the concept
of electric force—it is not amenable to any process of being
“transformed away” by a suitable change of framework.
H. Weyl, it seems, has developed a geometrical theory (in
hyper-space) in which no fundamental distinction is made
between gravitational and electrical forces.</p>

<p class='c005'>Einstein’s theory connects up the law of gravitation
with the laws of motion, and serves to establish a very
intimate relationship between matter and physical space-*time.
Space, time and matter (or energy) were considered
to be the three ultimate elements in Physics. The restricted
theory fused space-time into one indissoluble whole. The
generalised theory has further synthesised space-time and
matter into one fundamental physical reality. Space, time
and matter taken separately are more abstractions. Physical
reality consists of a synthesis of all three.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>P. C. Mahalanobis.</span></p>
<h3 id='note-a' class='c008'>Note A.</h3>
<p class='c004'>For example consider a massive particle resting on a
circular disc. If we set the disc rotating, a centrifugal force
appears in the field. On the other hand, if we transform
to a set of rotating axes, we must introduce a centrifugal
force in order to correct for the change of axes. This
newly introduced centrifugal force is usually looked upon
as a mathematical fiction—as “geometrical” rather than
physical. The presence of such a geometrical force is usually
interpreted as being due to the adoption of a fictitious
framework. On the other hand a gravitational force is
considered quite real. Thus a fundamental distinction is
made between geometrical and gravitational forces.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the General Theory of Relativity, this fundamental
distinction is done away with. The very possibility of
distinguishing between geometrical and gravitational forces
is denied. All axes of reference may now be regarded as
equally valid.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the Restricted Theory, all “unaccelerated” axes of
reference were recognised as equally valid, so that physical
laws were made independent of uniform absolute velocity.
In the General Theory, physical laws are made independent
of “absolute” motion of any kind.</p>

  <h2 id='art2' class='c003'>On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies <br />By<br /> A. Einstein.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c008'>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p class='c004'>It is well known that if we attempt to apply Maxwell’s
electrodynamics, as conceived at the present time, to
moving bodies, we are led to asymmetry which does not
agree with observed phenomena. Let us think of the
mutual action between a magnet and a conductor. The
observed phenomena in this case depend only on the
relative motion of the conductor and the magnet, while
according to the usual conception, a distinction must be
made between the cases where the one or the other of the
bodies is in motion. If, for example, the magnet moves
and the conductor is at rest, then an electric field of certain
energy-value is produced in the neighbourhood of the
magnet, which excites a current in those parts of the
field where a conductor exists. But if the magnet be at
rest and the conductor be set in motion, no electric field
is produced in the neighbourhood of the magnet, but an
electromotive force which corresponds to no energy in
itself is produced in the conductor; this causes an electric
current of the same magnitude and the same career as the
electric force, it being of course assumed that the relative
motion in both of these cases is the same.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. Examples of a similar kind such as the unsuccessful
attempt to substantiate the motion of the earth relative
to the “Light-medium” lead us to the supposition that
not only in mechanics, but also in electrodynamics, no
properties of observed facts correspond to a concept of
absolute rest; but that for all coordinate systems for which
the mechanical equations hold, the equivalent electrodynamical
and optical equations hold also, as has already been
shown for magnitudes of the first order. In the following
we make these assumptions (which we shall subsequently
call the Principle of Relativity) and introduce the further
assumption,—an assumption which is at the first sight
quite irreconcilable with the former one—that light is
propagated in vacant space, with a velocity <i>c</i> which is
independent of the nature of motion of the emitting
body. These two assumptions are quite sufficient to give
us a simple and consistent theory of electrodynamics of
moving bodies on the basis of the Maxwellian theory for
bodies at rest. The introduction of a “Lightäther”
will be proved to be superfluous, for according to the
conceptions which will be developed, we shall introduce
neither a space absolutely at rest, and endowed with
special properties, nor shall we associate a velocity-vector
with a point in which electro-magnetic processes take
place.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. Like every other theory in electrodynamics, the
theory is based on the kinematics of rigid bodies; in the
enunciation of every theory, we have to do with relations
between rigid bodies (co-ordinate system), clocks, and
electromagnetic processes. An insufficient consideration
of these circumstances is the cause of difficulties with
which the electrodynamics of moving bodies have to fight
at present.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>I.—KINEMATICAL PORTION.</h3>
<h4 id='sect2-1' class='c009'>§ 1. Definition of Synchronism.</h4>
<p class='c004'>Let us have a co-ordinate system, in which the Newtonian
equations hold. For distinguishing this system
from another which will be introduced hereafter, we
shall always call it “the stationary system.”</p>

<p class='c005'>If a material point be at rest in this system, then its
position in this system can be found out by a measuring
rod, and can be expressed by the methods of Euclidean
Geometry, or in Cartesian co-ordinates.</p>

<p class='c005'>If we wish to describe the motion of a material point,
the values of its coordinates must be expressed as functions
of time. It is always to be borne in mind that <i>such a
mathematical definition has a physical sense, only when we
have a clear notion of what is meant by time. We have to
take into consideration the fact that those of our conceptions, in
which time plays a part, are always conceptions of synchronism.</i>
For example, we say that a train arrives here at 7 o’clock;
this means that the exact pointing of the little hand of my
watch to 7, and the arrival of the train are synchronous
events.</p>

<p class='c005'>It may appear that all difficulties connected with the
definition of time can be removed when in place of time,
we substitute the position of the little hand of my watch.
Such a definition is in fact sufficient, when it is required to
define time exclusively for the place at which the clock is
stationed. But the definition is not sufficient when it is
required to connect by time events taking place at different
stations,—or what amounts to the same thing,—to estimate
by means of time (zeitlich werten) the occurrence of events,
which take place at stations distant from the clock.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now with regard to this attempt;—the time-estimation
of events, we can satisfy ourselves in the following
manner. Suppose an observer—who is stationed at the
origin of coordinates with the clock—associates a ray of
light which comes to him through space, and gives testimony
to the event of which the time is to be estimated,—with
the corresponding position of the hands of the clock. But
such an association has this defect,—it depends on the
position of the observer provided with the clock, as we
know by experience. We can attain to a more practicable
result by the following treatment.</p>

<p class='c005'>If an observer be stationed at A with a clock, he can
estimate the time of events occurring in the immediate
neighbourhood of A, by looking for the position of
the hands of the clock, which are synchronous with
the event. If an observer be stationed at B with a
clock,—we should add that the clock is of the same nature
as the one at A,—he can estimate the time of events
occurring about B. But without further premises, it is
not possible to compare, as far as time is concerned, the
events at B with the events at A. We have hitherto an
A-time, and a B-time, but no time common to A and B.
This last time (<i>i.e.</i>, common time) can be defined, if we
establish by definition that the time which light requires
in travelling from A to B is equivalent to the time which
light requires in travelling from B to A. For example,
a ray of light proceeds from A at A-time t<sub>A</sub> towards B,
arrives and is reflected from B at B-time t<sub>B</sub>, and returns
to A at A-time t′<sub>A</sub>. According to the definition, both
clocks are synchronous, if</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>t<sub>B</sub> - t<sub>A</sub> = t′<sub>A</sub> - t<sub>B</sub>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>We assume that this definition of synchronism is possible
without involving any inconsistency, for any number of
points, therefore the following relations hold:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. If the clock at B be synchronous with the clock
at A, then the clock at A is synchronous with the clock
at B.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. If the clock at A as well as the clock at B are
both synchronous with the clock at C, then the clocks at
A and B are synchronous.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus with the help of certain physical experiences, we
have established what we understand when we speak of
clocks at rest at different stations, and synchronous with
one another; and thereby we have arrived at a definition of
synchronism and time.</p>

<p class='c005'>In accordance with experience we shall assume that the
magnitude</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/form-006.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>where <i>c</i> is a universal constant.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have defined time essentially with a clock at rest
in a stationary system. On account of its adaptability
to the stationary system, we call the time defined in this
way as “time of the stationary system.”</p>
<h4 class='c009'>§ 2. On the Relativity of Length and Time.</h4>
<p class='c004'>The following reflections are based on the Principle
of Relativity and on the Principle of Constancy of the
velocity of light, both of which we define in the following
way:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. The laws according to which the nature of physical
systems alter are independent of the manner in which
these changes are referred to two co-ordinate systems
which have a uniform translators motion relative to each
other.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. Every ray of light moves in the “stationary
co-ordinate system” with the same velocity <i>c</i>, the velocity
being independent of the condition whether this ray of
light is emitted by a body at rest or in motion.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c007'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Therefore</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>velocity = Path of Light/Interval of time,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>where, by ‘interval of time’ we mean time as defined
in <a href='#sect2-1'>§1</a>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us have a rigid rod at rest; this has a length <i>l</i>,
when measured by a measuring rod at rest; we suppose
that the axis of the rod is laid along the X-axis of the
system at rest, and then a uniform velocity <i>v</i>, parallel
to the axis of X, is imparted to it. Let us now enquire
about the length of the moving rod; this can be obtained
by either of these operations.—</p>

<p class='c005'>(<i>a</i>) The observer provided with the measuring rod
moves along with the rod to be measured, and measures
by direct superposition the length of the rod:—just as if
the observer, the measuring rod, and the rod to be measured
were at rest.</p>

<p class='c005'>(<i>b</i>) The observer finds out, by means of clocks placed
in a system at rest (the clocks being synchronous as defined
in <a href='#sect2-1'>§1</a>), the points of this system where the ends of the
rod to be measured occur at a particular time <i>t</i>. The
distance between these two points, measured by the
previously used measuring rod, this time it being at rest,
is a length, which we may call the “length of the rod.”</p>

<p class='c005'>According to the Principle of Relativity, the length
found out by the operation <i>a</i>), which we may call “the
length of the rod in the moving system” is equal to the
length <i>l</i> of the rod in the stationary system.</p>

<p class='c005'>The length which is found out by the second method,
may be called ‘<i>the length of the moving rod measured from
the stationary system</i>.’ This length is to be estimated on
the basis of our principle, and <i>we shall find it to be different
from l</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the generally recognised kinematics, we silently
assume that the lengths defined by these two operations
are equal, or in other words, that at an epoch of time <i>t</i>,
a moving rigid body is geometrically replaceable by the
same body, which can replace it in the condition of rest.</p>
<h5 class='c009'>Relativity of Time.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Let us suppose that the two clocks synchronous with
the clocks in the system at rest are brought to the ends A,
and B of a rod, <i>i.e.</i>, the time of the clocks correspond to
the time of the stationary system at the points where they
happen to arrive; these clocks are therefore synchronous
in the stationary system.</p>

<p class='c005'>We further imagine that there are two observers at the
two watches, and moving with them, and that these
observers apply the criterion for synchronism to the two
clocks. At the time <i>t</i><sub>A</sub>, a ray of light goes out from A, is
reflected from B at the time <i>t</i><sub>B</sub>, and arrives back at A at
time <i>t′</i><sub>A</sub>. Taking into consideration the principle of,
constancy of the velocity of light, we have</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'><i>t</i><sub>B</sub> - <i>t</i><sub>A</sub> = <i>r</i><sub>AB</sub>/(<i>c</i> - <i>v</i>),</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>and       <i>t′</i><sub>A</sub> - <i>t</i><sub>B</sub> = <i>r</i><sub>AB</sub>/(<i>c</i> + <i>v</i>),</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>where <i>r</i><sub>AB</sub> is the length of the moving rod, measured
in the stationary system. Therefore the observers stationed
with the watches will not find the clocks synchronous,
though the observer in the stationary system must declare
the clocks to be synchronous. We therefore see that we can
attach no absolute significance to the concept of synchronism;
but two events which are synchronous when viewed
from one system, will not be synchronous when viewed
from a system moving relatively to this system.</p>
<h4 id='sect2-3' class='c009'>§ 3. Theory of Co-ordinate and Time-Transformation from a stationary system to a system which moves relatively to this with uniform velocity.</h4>
<p class='c004'>Let there be given, in the stationary system two
co-ordinate systems, <i>i.e.</i>, two series of three mutually
perpendicular lines issuing from a point. Let the X-axes
of each coincide with one another, and the Y and Z-axes
be parallel. Let a rigid measuring rod, and a number
of clocks be given to each of the systems, and let the rods
and clocks in each be exactly alike each other.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let the initial point of one of the systems (<i>k</i>) have
a constant velocity in the direction of the X-axis of
the other which is stationary system K, the motion being
also communicated to the rods and clocks in the system (<i>k</i>).
Any time <i>t</i> of the stationary system K corresponds to a
definite position of the axes of the moving system, which
are always parallel to the axes of the stationary system. By
<i>t</i>, we always mean the time in the stationary system.</p>

<p class='c005'>We suppose that the space is measured by the stationary
measuring rod placed in the stationary system, as well as
by the moving measuring rod placed in the moving
system, and we thus obtain the co-ordinates (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>) for the
stationary system, and (ξ, η, ζ) for the moving system. Let
the time <i>t</i> be determined for each point of the stationary
system (which are provided with clocks) by means of the
clocks which are placed in the stationary system, with
the help of light-signals as described in <a href='#sect2-1'>§ 1</a>. Let also
the time τ of the moving system be determined for each
point of the moving system (in which there are clocks which
are at rest relative to the moving system), by means of
the method of light signals between these points (in
which there are clocks) in the manner described in <a href='#sect2-1'>§ 1</a>.</p>

<p class='c005'>To every value of (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>) which fully determines
the position and time of an event in the stationary system,
there correspond a system of values (ξ, η, ζ, τ); now the
problem is to find out the system of equations connecting
these magnitudes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Primarily it is clear that on account of the property
of homogeneity which we ascribe to time and space, the
equations must be linear.</p>

<p class='c005'>If we put <i>x′</i> = <i>x</i> - <i>vt</i>, then it is clear that at a point
relatively at rest in the system <i>k</i>, we have a system of
values (<i>x′</i> <i>y</i> <i>z</i>) which are independent of time. Now
let us find out τ as a function of (<i>x′</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>). For this
purpose we have to express in equations the fact that τ is
not other than the time given by the clocks which are
at rest in the system <i>k</i> which must be made synchronous
in the manner described in <a href='#sect2-1'>§ 1</a>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let a ray of light be sent at time τ₀ from the origin
of the system <i>k</i> along the X-axis towards <i>x′</i> and let it be
reflected from that place at time τ₁ towards the origin
of moving co-ordinates and let it arrive there at time τ₂;
then we must have</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>If we now introduce the condition that τ is a function
of co-ordinates, and apply the principle of constancy of
the velocity of light in the stationary system, we have</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/form-007.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>It is to be noticed that instead of the origin of co-ordinates,
we could select some other point as the exit
point for rays of light, and therefore the above equation
holds for all values of (<i>x′</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>,).</p>

<p class='c005'>A similar conception, being applied to the <i>y</i>- and <i>z</i>-axis
gives us, when we take into consideration the fact that
light when viewed from the stationary system, is always
propagated along those axes with the velocity √(<i>c²</i> - <i>v²</i>),
we have the questions</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>From these equations it follows that τ is a linear function
of <i>x′</i> and <i>t</i>. From equations (1) we obtain</p>

<p class='c010'>where <i>a</i> is an unknown function of <i>v</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>With the help of these results it is easy to obtain the
magnitudes (ξ, η, ζ) if we express by means of equations
the fact that light, when measured in the moving system
is always propagated with the constant velocity <i>c</i> (as
the principle of constancy of light velocity in conjunction
with the principle of relativity requires). For a
time τ = 0, if the ray is sent in the direction of increasing
ξ, we have</p>

<p class='c010'>Now the ray of light moves relative to the origin of <i>k</i>

<h4 id='sect2-4' class='c009'>§ 4. The physical significance of the equations obtained concerning moving rigid bodies and moving clocks.</h4>
<p class='c004'>Let us consider a rigid sphere (<i>i.e.</i>, one having a
spherical figure when tested in the stationary system) of
radius R which is at rest relative to the system (K), and
whose centre coincides with the origin of K then the equation
of the surface of this sphere, which is moving with a
velocity <i>v</i> relative to K, is</p>

      <div class='line'>ξ<sup>2</sup> + η<sup>2</sup> + ζ<sup>2</sup> = R<sup>2</sup>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>At time <i>t</i> = 0, the equation is expressed by means of
(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>,) as</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/form-009.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>A rigid body which has the figure of a sphere when
measured in the moving system, has therefore in the
moving condition—when considered from the stationary
system, the figure of a rotational ellipsoid with semi-axes</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/form-010.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>Therefore the <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> dimensions of the sphere (therefore
of any figure also) do not appear to be modified by the
motion, but the <i>x</i> dimension is shortened in the ratio</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/form-011.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>the shortening is the larger, the larger
is <i>v</i>. For <i>v</i> = <i>c</i>, all moving bodies, when considered from
a stationary system shrink into planes. For a velocity
larger than the velocity of light, our propositions become
meaningless; in our theory <i>c</i> plays the part of infinite
velocity.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is clear that similar results hold about stationary
bodies in a stationary system when considered from a
uniformly moving system.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us now consider that a clock which is lying at rest
in the stationary system gives the time <i>t</i>, and lying
at rest relative to the moving system is capable of giving
the time τ;  suppose it to be placed at the origin of the
moving system <i>k</i>, and to be so arranged that it gives the
time τ. How much does the clock gain, when viewed from
the stationary system K? We have,</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/form-012.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>Therefore the clock loses by an amount ½(<i>v²</i>/<i>c²</i>) per second
of motion, to the second order of approximation.</p>

<p class='c005'>From this, the following peculiar consequence follows.
Suppose at two points A and B of the stationary system
two clocks are given which are synchronous in the sense
explained in § 3 when viewed from the stationary system.
Suppose the clock at A to be set in motion in the line
joining it with B, then after the arrival of the clock at B,
they will no longer be found synchronous, but the clock
which was set in motion from A will lag behind the clock
which had been all along at B by an amount ½<i>t</i>(<i>v²</i>/<i>c²</i>), where
<i>t</i> is the time required for the journey.</p>

<p class='c005'>We see forthwith that the result holds also when the
clock moves from A to B by a polygonal line, and also
when A and B coincide.</p>

<p class='c005'>If we assume that the result obtained for a polygonal
line holds also for a curved line, we obtain the following
law. If at A, there be two synchronous clocks, and if we
set in motion one of them with a constant velocity along a
closed curve till it comes back to A, the journey being
completed in <i>t</i>-seconds, then after arrival, the last mentioned
clock will be behind the stationary one by ½<i>t</i>(<i>v²</i>/<i>c²</i>)
seconds. From this, we conclude that a clock placed at
the equator must be slower by a very small amount than a
similarly constructed clock which is placed at the pole, all
other conditions being identical.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>§ 5. Addition-Theorem of Velocities.</h4>
<p class='c004'>Let a point move in the system <i>k</i> (which moves with
velocity <i>v</i> along the <i>x</i>-axis of the system K) according to
the equation</p>

of the ξ-axis of the moving system,</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/form-018.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>From this equation, we see that by combining two
velocities, each of which is smaller than <i>c</i>, we obtain a
velocity which is always smaller than <i>c</i>. If we put <i>v</i> = <i>c</i> - χ,

<p class='c005'>We have obtained the formula for U for the case when

by combining two transformations according to section

the system k´, of which the initial point moves
parallel to the ξ-axis with velocity <i>w</i>, then between the

<p class='c010'>For the interpretation of these equations, we make the
following remarks. Let us have a point-mass of electricity
which is of magnitude unity in the stationary system K,
<i>i.e.</i>, it exerts a unit force upon a similar quantity placed at
a distance of 1 cm. If this quantity of electricity be at
rest in the stationary system, then the force acting upon it
is equivalent to the vector (X, Y, Z) of electric force. But
if the quantity of electricity be at rest relative to the
moving system (at least for the moment considered), then
the force acting upon it, and measured in the moving
system is equivalent to the vector (X′, Y′, Z′). The first
three of equations (<a href='#eqn-2-1'>1</a>), (<a href='#eqn-2-2'>2</a>), (<a href='#eqn-2-3'>3</a>), can be expressed in the
following way:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. If a point-mass of electric unit pole moves in an
electro-magnetic field, then besides the electric force, an
electromotive force acts upon it, which, neglecting the
numbers involving the second and higher powers of <i>v</i>/<i>c</i>,
is equivalent to the vector-product of the velocity vector,
and the magnetic force divided by the velocity of light
(Old mode of expression).</p>

<p class='c005'>2. If a point-mass of electric unit pole moves in
an electro-magnetic field, then the force acting upon it is
equivalent to the electric force existing at the position of
the unit pole, which we obtain by the transformation of
the field to a co-ordinate system which is at rest relative
to the electric unit pole [New mode of expression].</p>

<p class='c005'>Similar theorems hold with reference to the magnetic
force. We see that in the theory developed the electro-magnetic
force plays the part of an auxiliary concept,
which owes its introduction in theory to the circumstance
that the electric and magnetic forces possess no existence
independent of the nature of motion of the co-ordinate
system.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is further clear that the asymmetry mentioned in the
introduction which occurs when we treat of the current
excited by the relative motion of a magnet and a conductor
disappears. Also the question about the seat of
electromagnetic energy is seen to be without any meaning.</p>

<p class='c005'>All problems of optics of moving bodies can be solved
after the method used here. The essential point is, that
the electric and magnetic forces of light, which are
influenced by a moving body, should be transformed to a
system of co-ordinates which is stationary relative to the
body. In this way, every problem of the optics of moving
bodies would be reduced to a series of problems of the
optics of stationary bodies.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>§ 9. Transformation of the Maxwell-Hertz Equations.</h4>
<p class='c004'>Let us start from the equations:—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/form-041.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>where</p>

<p class='c005'>denotes 4π times the density
of electricity, and (<i>u</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>, <i>u</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>, <i>u</i><sub><i>z</i></sub>) are the velocity-components
of electricity. If we now suppose that the electrical-masses
are bound unchangeably to small, rigid bodies
(Ions, electrons), then these equations form the electromagnetic
basis of Lorentz’s electrodynamics and optics for
moving bodies.</p>

<p class='c005'>If these equations which hold in the system K, are
transformed to the system <i>k</i> with the aid of the transformation-equations
given in <a href='#sect2-3'>§ 3</a> and <a href='#sect2-6'>§ 6</a>, then we obtain
the equations:—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/form-043.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />

<p class='c005'>where</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/form-044.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>Since the vector (<i>u</i><sub>ξ</sub>, <i>u</i><sub>η</sub>, <i>u</i><sub>ζ</sub>) is nothing but the
velocity of the electrical mass measured in the system <i>k</i>,
as can be easily seen from the addition-theorem of
velocities in <a href='#sect2-4'>§ 4</a>—so it is hereby shown, that by taking
our kinematical principle as the basis, the electromagnetic
basis of Lorentz’s theory of electrodynamics of moving
bodies correspond to the relativity-postulate. It can be
briefly remarked here that the following important law
follows easily from the equations developed in the present
section:—if an electrically charged body moves in any
manner in space, and if its charge does not change thereby,
when regarded from a system moving along with it, then
the charge remains constant even when it is regarded from
the stationary system K.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>§ 10. Dynamics of the Electron (slowly accelerated).</h4>

<p class='c005'>Let the electron possess the velocity <i>v</i> at a certain

to which the electron will move in the ‘particle of time’

<p class='c005'>Without influencing the generality of treatment, we can

relative to the system <i>k</i>, which moves parallel to the X-axis
with the constant velocity <i>v</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the suppositions made above, in combination

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>and let us first remark, that <i>e</i>X′, <i>e</i>Y′, <i>e</i>Z′ are the components
of the ponderomotive force acting upon the
electron, and are considered in a moving system which, at
this moment, moves with a velocity which is equal to that
of the electron. This force can, for example, be measured
by means of a spring-balance which is at rest in this last
system. If we briefly call this force as “the force acting
upon the electron,” and maintain the equation:—</p>

<p class='c005'>Mass-number × acceleration-number = force-number, and
if we further fix that the accelerations are measured in
the stationary system K, then from the above equations,
we obtain:—</p>

<p class='c005'>Longitudinal mass:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/form-046.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>Transversal mass:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/form-047.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>Naturally, when other definitions are given of the force
and the acceleration, other numbers are obtained for the
mass; hence we see that we must proceed very carefully
in comparing the different theories of the motion of the
electron.</p>

<p class='c005'>We remark that this result about the mass hold also
for ponderable material mass; for in our sense, a ponderable
material point may be made into an electron by the
addition of an electrical charge which may be as small as
possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us now determine the kinetic energy of the
electron. If the electron moves from the origin of co-ordinates
of the system K with the initial velocity 0 steadily
along the X-axis under the action of an electromotive
force X, then it is clear that the energy drawn from the
electrostatic field has the value ∫<i>e</i>X<i>dx</i>. Since the electron
is only slowly accelerated, and in consequence, no energy
is given out in the form of radiation, therefore the energy
drawn from the electro-static field may be put equal to
the energy W of motion. Considering the whole process of
motion in questions, the first of equations <a href='#eqn-2-A'>A)</a> holds, we
obtain:—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/form-048.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>For <i>v</i> = <i>c</i>, W is infinitely great. As our former result
shows, velocities exceeding that of light can have no
possibility of existence.</p>

<p class='c005'>In consequence of the arguments mentioned above,
this expression for kinetic energy must also hold for
ponderable masses.</p>

<p class='c005'>We can now enumerate the characteristics of the
motion of the electrons available for experimental verification,
which follow from equations <a href='#eqn-2-A'>A)</a>.</p>

<p class='c005'>1. From the second of equations <a href='#eqn-2-A'>A)</a>, it follows that
an electrical force Y, and a magnetic force N produce
equal deflexions of an electron moving with the velocity
<i>v</i>, when Y = N<i>v</i>/<i>c</i>. Therefore we see that according to
our theory, it is possible to obtain the velocity of an
electron from the ratio of the magnetic deflexion A<sub><i>m</i></sub>, and
the electric deflexion A<sub><i>e</i></sub>, by applying the law:—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/form-049.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>This relation can be tested by means of experiments
because the velocity of the electron can be directly
measured by means of rapidly oscillating electric and
magnetic fields.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. From the value which is deduced for the kinetic
energy of the electron, it follows that when the electron
falls through a potential difference of P, the velocity <i>v</i>
which is acquired is given by the following relation:—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/form-050.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>3. We calculate the radius of curvature R of the
path, where the only deflecting force is a magnetic force N
acting perpendicular to the velocity of projection. From
the second of equations <a href='#eqn-2-A'>A)</a> we obtain:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>

theory.</p>

  <h2 id='art3' class='c003'>ALBRECHT EINSTEIN <br /> [<i>A short biographical note.</i>]</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>The name of Prof. Albrecht Einstein has now spread far
beyond the narrow pale of scientific investigators owing to
the brilliant confirmation of his predicted deflection of
light-rays by the gravitational field of the sun during the
total solar eclipse of May 29, 1919. But to the serious
student of science, he has been known from the beginning
of the current century, and many dark problems in physics
has been illuminated with the lustre of his genius, before,
owing to the latest sensation just mentioned, he flashes out
before public imagination as a scientific star of the first
magnitude.</p>

<p class='c005'>Einstein is a Swiss-German of Jewish extraction, and
began his scientific career as a privat-dozent in the Swiss
University of Zürich about the year 1902. Later on, he
migrated to the German University of Prague in Bohemia
as ausser-ordentliche (or associate) Professor. In 1914,
through the exertions of Prof. M. Planck of the Berlin
University, he was appointed a paid member of the Royal
(now National) Prussian Academy of Sciences, on a
salary of 18,000 marks per year. In this post, he has
only to do and guide research work. Another distinguished
occupant of the same post was Van’t Hoff, the eminent
physical chemist.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is rather difficult to give a detailed, and consistent
chronological account of his scientific activities,—they are
so variegated, and cover such a wide field. The first work
which gained him distinction was an investigation on
Brownian Movement. An admirable account will be found
in Perrin’s book ‘The Atoms.’ Starting from Boltzmann’s
theorem connecting the entropy, and the probability of a
state, he deduced a formula on the mean displacement of
small particles (colloidal) suspended in a liquid. This
formula gives us one of the best methods for finding out a
very fundamental number in physics—namely—the number
of molecules in one gm. molecule of gas (Avogadro’s
number). The formula was shortly afterwards verified by
Perrin, Prof. of Chemical Physics in the Sorbonne, Paris.</p>

<p class='c005'>To Einstein is also due the resuscitation of Planck’s
quantum theory of energy-emission. This theory has not
yet caught the popular imagination to the same extent as
the new theory of Time, and Space, but it is none the less
iconoclastic in its scope as far as classical concepts are
concerned. It was known for a long time that the
observed emission of light from a heated black body did
not correspond to the formula which could be deduced from
the older classical theories of continuous emission and
propagation. In the year 1900, Prof. Planck of the Berlin
University worked out a formula which was based on the
bold assumption that energy was emitted and absorbed by
the molecules in multiples of the quantity <i>h</i>ν, where <i>h</i>
is a constant (which is universal like the constant of
gravitation), and ν is the frequency of the light.</p>

<p class='c005'>The conception was so radically different from all
accepted theories that in spite of the great success of
Planck’s radiation formula in explaining the observed facts
of black-body radiation, it did not meet with much favour
from the physicists. In fact, some one remarked jocularly
that according to Planck, energy flies out of a radiator like
a swarm of gnats.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Einstein found a support for the new-born concept
in another direction. It was known that if green or ultraviolet
light was allowed to fall on a plate of some alkali metal,
the plate lost electrons. The electrons were emitted with
all velocities, but there is generally a maximum limit.
From the investigations of Lenard and Ladenburg, the
curious discovery was made that this maximum velocity of
emission did not at all depend upon the intensity of light,
but upon its wavelength. The more violet was the light,
the greater was the velocity of emission.</p>

<p class='c005'>To account for this fact, Einstein made the bold
assumption that the light is propagated in space as a unit
pulse (he calls it a Light-cell), and falling upon an
individual atom, liberates electrons according to the energy
equation</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>1</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>where (<i>m</i>, <i>v</i>) are the mass and velocity of the electron.
A is a constant characteristic of the metal plate.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was little material for the confirmation of this
law when it was first proposed (1905), and eleven years
elapsed before Prof. Millikan established, by a set of
experiments scarcely rivalled for the ingenuity, skill, and
care displayed, the absolute truth of the law. As results of
this confirmation, and other brilliant triumphs, the quantum
law is now regarded as a fundamental law of Energetics.
In recent years, X-rays have been added to the domain of
light, and in this direction also, Einstein’s photo-electric
formula has proved to be one of the most fruitful
conceptions in Physics.</p>

<p class='c005'>The quantum law was next extended by Einstein to the
problems of decrease of specific heat at low temperature,
and here also his theory was confirmed in a brilliant
manner.</p>

<p class='c005'>We pass over his other contributions to the equation of
state, to the problems of null-point energy, and photo-chemical
reactions. The recent experimental works of
Nernst and Warburg seem to indicate that through
Einstein’s genius, we are probably for the first time having
a satisfactory theory of photo-chemical action.</p>

<p class='c005'>In 1915, Einstein made an excursion into Experimental
Physics, and here also, in his characteristic way, he tackled
one of the most fundamental concepts of Physics. It is
well-known that according to Ampere, the magnetisation
of iron and iron-like bodies, when placed within a coil
carrying an electric current is due to the excitation in the
metal of small electrical circuits. But the conception
though a very fruitful one, long remained without a trace
of experimental proof, though after the discovery of the
electron, it was generally believed that these molecular
currents may be due to the rotational motion of free
electrons within the metal. It is easily seen that if in the
process of magnetisation, a number of electrons be set into
rotatory motion, then these will impart to the metal itself
a turning couple. The experiment is a rather difficult one,
and many physicists tried in vain to observe the effect.
But in collaboration with de Haas, Einstein planned and
successfully carried out this experiment, and proved the
essential correctness of Ampere’s views.</p>

<p class='c005'>Einstein’s studies on Relativity were commenced in the
year 1905, and has been continued up to the present time.
The first paper in the present collection forms Einstein’s
first great contribution to the Principle of Special
Relativity. We have recounted in the introduction how out
of the chaos and disorder into which the electrodynamics
and optics of moving bodies had fallen previous to 1895,
Lorentz, Einstein and Minkowski have succeeded in
building up a consistent, and fruitful new theory of Time
and Space.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Einstein was not satisfied with the study of the
special problem of Relativity for uniform motion, but
tried, in a series of papers beginning from 1911, to extend
it to the case of non-uniform motion. The last paper in
the present collection is a translation of a comprehensive
article which he contributed to the Annalen der Physik in
1916 on this subject, and gives, in his own words, the
Principles of Generalized Relativity. The triumphs of
this theory are now matters of public knowledge.</p>

<p class='c005'>Einstein is now only 45, and it is to be hoped that
science will continue to be enriched, for a long time to
come, with further achievements of his genius.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='art4' class='c003'>Principle of Relativity</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c008'>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p class='c004'>At the present time, different opinions are being held
about the fundamental equations of Electro-dynamics for
moving bodies. The Hertzian<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c007'><sup>[9]</sup></a> forms must be given up,
for it has appeared that they are contrary to many experimental
results.</p>

<p class='c005'>In 1895 H. A. Lorentz<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c007'><sup>[10]</sup></a> published his theory of optical
and electrical phenomena in moving bodies; this theory
was based upon the atomistic conception (vorstellung) of
electricity, and on account of its great success appears to
have justified the bold hypotheses, by which it has been
ushered into existence. In his theory, Lorentz proceeds
from certain equations, which must hold at every point of
“Äther”; then by forming the average values over “Physically
infinitely small” regions, which however contain
large numbers of electrons, the equations for electro-magnetic
processes in moving bodies can be successfully built
up.</p>

<p class='c005'>In particular, Lorentz’s theory gives a good account of
the non-existence of relative motion of the earth and the
luminiferous “Äther”; it shows that this fact is intimately
connected with the covariance of the original equation,
when certain simultaneous transformations of the space and
time co-ordinates are effected; these transformations have
therefore obtained from H. Poincare<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c007'><sup>[11]</sup></a> the name of Lorentz-transformations.
The covariance of these fundamental
equations, when subjected to the Lorentz-transformation
is a purely mathematical fact <i>i.e.</i> not based on any physical
considerations; I will call this the Theorem of Relativity;
this theorem rests essentially on the form of the
differential equations for the propagation of waves with
the velocity of light.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now without <i>recognizing</i> any hypothesis about the connection
between “Äther” and matter, we can expect these
mathematically evident theorems to have their consequences
so far extended—that thereby even those laws of ponderable
media which are yet unknown may anyhow possess
this covariance when subjected to a Lorentz-transformation;
by saying this, we do not indeed express an opinion, but
rather a conviction,—and this conviction I may be permitted
to call the Postulate of Relativity. The position of
affairs here is almost the same as when the Principle of
Conservation of Energy was postulated in cases, where the
corresponding forms of energy were unknown.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now if hereafter, we succeed in maintaining this
covariance as a definite connection between pure and simple
observable phenomena in moving bodies, the definite connection
may be styled ‘the Principle of Relativity.’</p>

<p class='c005'>These differentiations seem to me to be necessary for
enabling us to characterise the present day position of the
electro-dynamics for moving bodies.</p>

<p class='c005'>H. A. Lorentz<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c007'><sup>[12]</sup></a> has found out the “Relativity theorem”
and has created the Relativity-postulate as a hypothesis
that electrons and matter suffer contractions in consequence
of their motion according to a certain law.</p>

<p class='c005'>A. Einstein<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c007'><sup>[13]</sup></a> has brought out the point very clearly,
that this postulate is not an artificial hypothesis but is
rather a new way of comprehending the time-concept
which is forced upon us by observation of natural phenomena.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Principle of Relativity has not yet been formulated
for electro-dynamics of moving bodies in the sense
characterized by me. In the present essay, while formulating
this principle, I shall obtain the fundamental equations
for moving bodies in a sense which is uniquely determined
by this principle.</p>

<p class='c005'>But it will be shown that none of the forms hitherto
assumed for these equations can exactly fit in with this
principle.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c007'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>We would at first expect that the fundamental equations
which are assumed by Lorentz for moving bodies
would correspond to the Relativity Principle. But it will
be shown that this is not the case for the general equations
which Lorentz has for any possible, and also for magnetic
bodies; but this is approximately the case (if neglect the
square of the velocity of matter in comparison to the
velocity of light) for those equations which Lorentz hereafter
infers for non-magnetic bodies. But this latter
accordance with the Relativity Principle is due to the fact
that the condition of non-magnetisation has been formulated
in a way not corresponding to the Relativity Principle;
therefore the accordance is due to the fortuitous compensation
of two contradictions to the Relativity-Postulate.
But meanwhile enunciation of the Principle in a rigid
manner does not signify any contradiction to the hypotheses
of Lorentz’s molecular theory, but it shall become clear that
the assumption of the contraction of the electron in
Lorentz’s theory must be introduced at an earlier stage
than Lorentz has actually done.</p>

<p class='c005'>In an appendix, I have gone into discussion of the
position of Classical Mechanics with respect to the
Relativity Postulate. Any easily perceivable modification
of mechanics for satisfying the requirements of the
Relativity theory would hardly afford any noticeable
difference in observable processes; but would lead to very
surprising consequences. By laying down the Relativity-Postulate
from the outset, sufficient means have been
created for deducing henceforth the complete series of
Laws of Mechanics from the principle of conservation of
Energy alone (the form of the Energy being given in
explicit forms).</p>
<h4 class='c009'>NOTATIONS.</h4>
<p class='c004'>Let a rectangular system (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>,) of reference be
given in space and time. The unit of time shall be chosen
in such a manner with reference to the unit of length that
the velocity of light in space becomes unity.</p>

<p class='c005'>Although I would prefer not to change the notations
used by Lorentz, it appears important to me to use a
different selection of symbols, for thereby certain homogeneity
will appear from the very beginning. I shall
denote the vector electric force by E, the magnetic
induction by M, the electric induction by <i>e</i> and the
magnetic force by <i>m</i>, so that (E, M, <i>e</i>, <i>m</i>) are used instead
of Lorentz’s (E, B, D, H) respectively.</p>

<p class='c005'>I shall further make use of complex magnitudes in a
way which is not yet current in physical investigations,
<i>i.e.</i>, instead of operating with (<i>t</i>), I shall operate with (<i>i t</i>),
where <i>i</i> denotes  √(-1). If now instead of (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>i t</i>), I
use the method of writing with indices, certain essential
circumstances will come into evidence; on this will be
based a general use of the suffixes (1, 2, 3, 4). The
advantage of this method will be, as I expressly emphasize
here, that we shall have to handle symbols which have
apparently a purely real appearance; we can however at
any moment pass to real equations if it is understood that
of the symbols with indices, such ones as have the suffix
4 only once, denote imaginary quantities, while those
which have not at all the suffix 4, or have it twice denote
real quantities.</p>

(<i>x₁</i> <i>x₂</i> <i>x₃</i> <i>x₄</i>) shall be called a space-time point.</p>

<p class='c005'>Further let <i>u</i> denote the velocity vector of matter, ε the
dielectric constant, μ the magnetic permeability, σ the
conductivity of matter, while ρ denotes the density of
electricity in space, and <i>x</i> the vector of “Electric Current”
which we shall some across in <a href='#sect4-7'>§7</a> and <a href='#sect4-8'>§8</a>.</p>

<p class='c005'>The last vertical column of co-efficients has to fulfil
the condition 22) <i>a₁₄²</i> + <i>a₂₄²</i> + <i>a₃₄²</i> + <i>a₄₄²</i>  = 1.</p>

<p class='c005'>If <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>it</i> (space co-ordinates, and time <i>it</i>) is subjected

into essentially corresponding relations between the
corresponding magnitudes newly introduced into the
system.</p>

<p class='c005'>These facts can be more concisely expressed in these
words: the system of equations (I and II) as well as the
system of equations (III) (IV) are covariant in all cases
of Lorentz-transformation, where (ρ<i>u</i>, <i>i</i>ρ) is to be transformed

is a space-time vector of the 2nd kind.</p>

<p class='c005'>I shall add a few more remarks here in order to elucidate
the conception of space-time vector of the 2nd kind.

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A space-time vector of the second kind (<i>m</i> - <i>ie</i>), where
(<i>m</i> and <i>e</i>) are real magnitudes, may be called singular,
when the scalar square (<i>m</i> - <i>ie</i>)² = 0, <i>ie</i> <i>m²</i> - <i>e²</i> = 0, and at
the same time (<i>m e</i>) = 0, <i>ie</i> the vector <i>m</i> and <i>e</i> are equal and
perpendicular to each other; when such is the case, these
two properties remain conserved for the space-time vector
of the 2nd kind in every Lorentz-transformation.</p>

<p class='c005'>If the space-time vector of the 2nd kind is not
singular, we rotate the spacial co-ordinate system in such
a manner that the vector-product [<i>me</i>] coincides with
the Z-axis, <i>i.e.</i> <i>m</i><sub><i>x</i></sub> = 0, <i>e</i><sub><i>x</i></sub> = 0. Then</p>

<p class='c010'>Therefore (<i>e</i><sub><i>y</i></sub> + <i>i m</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>)/(<i>e</i><sub><i>x</i></sub> + <i>i e</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>) is different from +<i>i</i>,

<p class='c010'>If then, by referring back to equations (9), we carry out

and therefore <i>m</i> and <i>e</i> shall both coincide with the new
Z-axis. Then by means of the invariants <i>m²</i> - <i>e²</i>, (<i>me</i>)
the final values of these vectors, whether they are of the

equal to zero, would be at once settled.</p>
<h3 id='sect4-6' class='c008'>§ 6. Concept of Time.</h3>
<p class='c004'>By the Lorentz transformation, we are allowed to effect
certain <i>changes</i> of the time parameter. In consequence
of this fact, it is no longer permissible to speak of the
absolute simultaneity of two events. The ordinary idea
of simultaneity rather presupposes that six independent
parameters, which are evidently required for defining a
system of space and time axes, are somehow reduced to
three. Since we are accustomed to consider that these
limitations represent in a unique way the actual facts
very approximately, we maintain that the simultaneity of
two events exists of themselves.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c007'><sup>[18]</sup></a> In fact, the following
considerations will prove conclusive.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let a reference system (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>) for space time points
(events) be somehow known. Now if a space point A
(<i>x₀</i>, <i>y₀</i>, <i>z₀</i>) the time <i>t₀</i> be compared with a space
point P (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>) at the time <i>t</i>, and if the difference of
time <i>t</i> - <i>t₀</i>, (let <i>t</i> > <i>t₀</i>) be less than the length A P <i>i.e.</i> less
than the time required for the propagation of light from
A to P, and if <i>q</i> = (<i>t</i> - <i>t₀</i>)/(A P) &lt; 1, then by a special Lorentz
transformation, in which A P is taken as the axis, and which
has the moment <i>q</i>, we can introduce a time parameter <i>t′</i>, which
(see equation 11, 12, § 4) has got the same value <i>t′</i> = <i>0</i> for
both space-time points (A, <i>t₀</i>), and (P, t). So the two
events can now be comprehended to be simultaneous.</p>

<p class='c005'>Further, let us take at the same time <i>t₀</i> = 0, two
different space-points A, B, or three space-points (A, B, C)
which are not in the same space-line, and compare
therewith a space point P, which is outside the line A B,
or the plane A B C, at another time <i>t</i>, and let the time
difference <i>t</i> - <i>t₀</i> (t > <i>t₀</i>) be less than the time which light
requires for propagation from the line A B, or the plane
(A B C) to P. Let q be the quotient of (<i>t</i> - <i>t₀</i>) by the
second time. Then if a Lorentz transformation is taken
in which the perpendicular from P on A B, or from P on
the plane A B C is the axis, and q is the moment, then
all the three (or four) events (A, <i>t₀</i>), (B, <i>t₀</i>), (C, <i>t₀</i>) and
(P, t) are simultaneous.</p>

<p class='c005'>If four space-points, which do not lie in one plane, are
conceived to be at the same time <i>t₀</i>, then it is no longer permissible
to make a change of the time parameter by a Lorentz-transformation,
without at the same time destroying the
character of the simultaneity of these four space points.</p>

<p class='c005'>To the mathematician, accustomed on the one hand to
the methods of treatment of the poly-dimensional
manifold, and on the other hand to the conceptual figures
of the so-called non-Euclidean Geometry, there can be no
difficulty in adopting this concept of time to the application
of the Lorentz-transformation. The paper of Einstein which
has been cited in the Introduction, has succeeded to some
extent in presenting the nature of the transformation
from the physical standpoint.</p>

us turn to the electro-magnetic phenomena in matter.
We look for those relations which make it possible for
us—when proper fundamental data are given—to
obtain the following quantities at every place and time,
and therefore at every space-time point as functions of
(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>):—the vector of the electric force E, the
magnetic induction M, the electrical induction <i>e</i>, the
magnetic force <i>m</i>, the electrical space-density ρ, the
electric current s (whose relation hereafter to the conduction
current is known by the manner in which conductivity
occurs in the process), and lastly the vector <i>v</i>, the
velocity of matter.</p>

<p class='c005'>The relations in question can be divided into two
classes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Firstly—those equations, which,—when <i>v</i>, the velocity
of matter is given as a function of (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>),—lead us to
a knowledge of other magnitude as functions of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>—I
shall call this first class of equations the fundamental
equations—</p>

<p class='c005'>Secondly, the expressions for the ponderomotive force,
which, by the application of the Laws of Mechanics, gives
us further information about the vector <i>u</i> as functions of
(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>).</p>

<p class='c005'>For the case of bodies at rest, <i>i.e.</i> when <i>u</i> (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>)
= 0 the theories of Maxwell (Heaviside, Hertz) and
Lorentz lead to the same fundamental equations. They
are;—</p>

<p class='c005'>(1) The Differential Equations:—which contain no
constant referring to matter:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(<i>i</i>) Curl <i>m</i> - δ<i>e</i>/δ<i>t</i> = C,</div>
      <div class='line'>(<i>ii</i>) div <i>e</i> = lρ.</div>
      <div class='line'>(<i>iii</i>) Curl E + δM/δ<i>t</i> = 0,</div>
      <div class='line'>(<i>iv</i>) Div M = 0.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>(2) Further relations, which characterise the influence
of existing matter for the most important case to which
we limit ourselves <i>i.e.</i> for isotopic bodies;—they are comprised
in the equations</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(V) <i>e</i> = ε E, M = μ<i>m</i>, C = σE.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>where ε = dielectric constant, μ = magnetic permeability,
σ = the conductivity of matter, all given as function of
<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>; <i>s</i> is here the conduction current.</p>

<p class='c005'>By employing a modified form of writing, I shall now
cause a latent symmetry in these equations to appear.
I put, as in the previous work,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'><i>x₁</i> = <i>x</i>, <i>x₂</i> = <i>y</i>, <i>x₃</i> = <i>z</i>, <i>x₄</i> = <i>it</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>and write <i>s₁</i>, <i>s₂</i>, <i>s₃</i>, <i>s₄</i> for C<sub><i>x</i></sub>, C<sub><i>y</i></sub>, C<sub><i>z</i></sub> (√-1)ρ.</p>

<p class='c005'>Further <i>f₂₃</i>, <i>f₃₁</i>, <i>f₁₂</i>, <i>f₁₄</i>, <i>f₂₄</i>, <i>f₃₄</i></p>

<p class='c005'>for <i>m</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>, <i>m</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>, <i>m</i><sub><i>z</i></sub>, -<i>i</i>(<i>e</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>, <i>e</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>, <i>e</i><sub><i>z</i></sub>),</p>

<p class='c005'>and F₂₃, F₃₁, F₁₂, F₁₄, F₂₄, F₃₄</p>

<p class='c005'>for M<sub><i>x</i></sub>, M<sub><i>y</i></sub>, M<sub><i>z</i></sub>, -<i>i</i>(E<sub><i>x</i></sub>, E<sub><i>y</i></sub>, E<sub><i>z</i></sub>)</p>

<p class='c005'>lastly we shall have the relation <i>f</i><sub>k h</sub> = - <i>f</i><sub><i>h k</i></sub>, <i>F</i><sub><i>k h</i></sub> = -<i>F</i><sub><i>h k</i></sub>,
(the letter <i>f</i>, F shall denote the field, <i>s</i> the (<i>i.e.</i> current).</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the fundamental Equations can be written as</p>

<h3 id='sect4-8' class='c008'>§ 8. The Fundamental Equations.</h3>
<p class='c004'>We are now in a position to establish in a unique way
the fundamental equations for bodies moving in any manner
by means of these three axioms exclusively.</p>

<p class='c005'>The first Axion shall be,—</p>

<p class='c005'>When a detached region<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c007'><sup>[19]</sup></a> of matter is at rest at any
moment, therefore the vector <i>u</i> is zero, for a system
(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>)—the neighbourhood may be supposed to be
in motion in any possible manner, then for the space-time
point <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>, the same relations (A) (B) (V) which
hold in the case when all matter is at rest, shall also
hold between ρ, the vectors C, <i>e</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>M</i>, <i>E</i> and their differentials
with respect to <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>. The second axiom shall
be:—</p>

<p class='c005'>Every velocity of matter is &lt; 1, smaller than the velocity
of propagation of light.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c007'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>The fundamental equations are of such a kind that
when (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>it</i>) are subjected to a Lorentz transformation
and thereby (<i>m</i> - <i>ie</i>) and (<i>M</i> - <i>iE</i>) are transformed into
space-time vectors of the second kind, (C, <i>i</i>ρ) as a space-time
vector of the 1st kind, the equations are transformed into
essentially identical forms involving the transformed
magnitudes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Shortly I can signify the third axiom as:—</p>

<p class='c005'>(<i>m</i>, -<i>ie</i>), and (<i>M</i>, -<i>iE</i>) are space-time vectors of the
second kind, (C, <i>i</i>p) is a space-time vector of the first kind.</p>

<p class='c005'>This axiom I call the Principle of Relativity.</p>

<p class='c005'>In fact these three axioms lead us from the previously
mentioned fundamental equations for bodies at rest to the
equations for moving bodies in an unambiguous way.</p>

<p class='c005'>According to the second axiom, the magnitude of the
velocity vector | <i>u</i> | is &lt; 1 at any space-time point. In
consequence, we can always write, instead of the vector <i>u</i>,
the following set of four allied quantities</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>ω₁ = u<sub><i>x</i></sub>/√(1 - <i>u²</i>),</div>
      <div class='line'>ω₂ = u<sub><i>y</i></sub>/√(1 - u²),</div>
      <div class='line'>ω₃ = u<sub><i>z</i></sub>/√(1 - u²),</div>
      <div class='line'>ω₄ = <i>i</i>/√(1 - u²)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>with the relation</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(27) ω₁² + ω₂² + ω₃² + ω₄² = - |</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>From what has been said at the end of <a href='#sect4-4'>§ 4</a>, it is clear
that in the case of a Lorentz-transformation, this set
behaves like a space-time vector of the 1st kind.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us now fix our attention on a certain point (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>)
of matter at a certain time (<i>t</i>). If at this space-time
point <i>u</i> = 0, then we have at once for this point the equations
(<i>A</i>), (<i>B</i>) (<i>V</i>) of <a href='#sect4-7'>§ 7</a>. If <i>u</i> ≠ 0, then there exists
according to 16), in case | <i>u</i> | &lt; 1, a special Lorentz-transformation,
whose vector <i>v</i> is equal to this vector <i>u</i> (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>,
<i>t</i>), and we pass on to a new system of reference (<i>x′</i> <i>y′</i> <i>z′</i> <i>t′</i>)
in accordance with this transformation. Therefore for
the space-time point considered, there arises as in <a href='#sect4-4'>§ 4</a>,
the new values 28) ω′₁ = 0, ω′₂ = 0, ω′₃ = 0, ω′₄ = <i>i</i>,
therefore the new velocity vector ω′ = 0, the space-time
point is as if transformed to rest. Now according to the
third axiom the system of equations for the transformed
point (<i>x′</i> <i>y′</i> <i>z′</i> <i>t</i>) involves the newly introduced magnitude
(<i>u′</i> ρ′, C′, <i>e′</i>, <i>m′</i>, <i>E′</i>, <i>M′</i>) and their differential quotients
with respect to (<i>x′</i>, <i>y′</i>, <i>z′</i>, <i>t′</i>) in the same manner as the
original equations for the point (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>). But according
to the first axiom, when <i>u′</i> = 0, these equations must be
exactly equivalent to</p>

<p class='c005'>(1) the differential equations (<i>A′</i>), (<i>B′</i>), which are
obtained from the equations (<i>A</i>), (<i>B</i>) by simply dashing
the symbols in (<i>A</i>) and (<i>B</i>).</p>

<p class='c005'>(2) and the equations</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(V′) <i>e′</i> = ε<i>E′</i>, <i>M’</i> = μ<i>m′</i>, <i>C′</i> = σ<i>E′</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>where ε, μ, σ are the dielectric constant, magnetic permeability,
and conductivity for the system (<i>x′</i> <i>y′</i> <i>z′</i> <i>t′</i>) <i>i.e.</i> in
the space-time point (<i>x</i> <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> <i>t</i>) of matter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now let us return, by means of the reciprocal Lorentz-transformation
to the original variables (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>), and the
magnitudes (<i>u</i>, ρ, C, <i>e</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>E</i>, <i>M</i>) and the equations, which
we then obtain from the last mentioned, will be the fundamental
equations sought by us for the moving bodies.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now from <a href='#sect4-4'>§ 4</a>, and <a href='#sect4-6'>§ 6</a>, it is to be seen that the equations
<i>A</i>), as well as the equations <i>B</i>) are covariant for a
Lorentz-transformation, <i>i.e.</i> the equations, which we obtain
backwards from <i>A′</i>) <i>B′</i>), must be exactly of the same form
as the equations <i>A</i>) and <i>B</i>), as we take them for bodies
at rest. We have therefore as the first result:—</p>

<p class='c005'>The differential equations expressing the fundamental
equations of electrodynamics for moving bodies, when
written in ρ and the vectors C, <i>e</i>, <i>m</i>, E, M, are exactly of
the same form as the equations for moving bodies. The
velocity of matter does not enter in these equations. In
the vectorial way of writing, we have</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I) curl <i>m</i> - ∂<i>e</i>/∂<i>t</i> = C₁,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>II) div <i>e</i> = ρ</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>III) curl E + ∂M/∂<i>t</i> = 0</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>IV) div M = 0</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The velocity of matter occurs only in the auxiliary
equations which characterise the influence of matter on the
basis of their characteristic constants ε, μ, σ. Let us now
transform these auxiliary equations V′) into the original
co-ordinates (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, and <i>t</i>.)</p>

<p class='c005'>According to formula 15) in <a href='#sect4-4'>§ 4</a>, the component of <i>e′</i>
in the direction of the vector <i>u</i> is the same as that of
(<i>e</i> + [<i>u</i> <i>m</i>]), the component of <i>m′</i> is the same as that of
<i>m</i> - [<i>u</i> <i>e</i>], but for the perpendicular direction <i>ū</i>, the components
of <i>e′</i>, <i>m′</i> are the same as those of (<i>e</i> + [<i>u</i> <i>m</i>]) and (<i>m</i>
- [<i>u</i> <i>e</i>], multiplied by 1/√(1 - <i>u²</i>). On the other hand E′
and M′ shall stand to E + [<i>u</i>M], and M - [<i>u</i>E] in the
same relation as <i>e′</i> and <i>m′</i> to <i>e</i> + [<i>um</i>], and <i>m</i> - (<i>ue</i>).
From the relation <i>e′</i> = εE′, the following equations follow</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(C) <i>e</i> + [<i>um</i>] = ε(E + [<i>u</i>M]),</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>and from the relation M′ = μ<i>m′</i>, we have</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(D) M - [<i>u</i> E] = μ(<i>m</i> - [<i>ue</i>]),</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>For the components in the directions perpendicular
to <i>u</i>, and to each other, the equations are to be multiplied
by √(1 - <i>u²</i>).</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the following equations follow from the transformation?
equations (12), (10), (11) in <a href='#sect4-4'>§ 4</a>, when we replace
q, <i>r</i><sub><i>v</i></sub>, <i>r</i><sub><i>ṽ</i></sub>, <i>t</i>, <i>r′</i><sub><i>v</i></sub>, <i>r′</i><sub><i>ṽ</i></sub>, <i>t’</i> by |<i>u</i>|, C<sub><i>u</i></sub>, C<sub><i>ū</i></sub>, ρ, C′<sub><i>u</i></sub>, C′<sub><i>ū</i></sub>, ρ′</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>ρ′ = (-|<i>u</i>| C<sub><i>u</i></sub> + ρ)/√(1 - <i>u²</i>),</div>
      <div class='line'>C’<sub><i>u</i></sub> = (C<sub><i>u</i></sub> - |<i>u</i>|ρ)/√(1 - <i>u²</i>),</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In consideration of the manner in which σ enters into
these relations, it will be convenient to call the vector
C - ρ<i>u</i> with the components C<sub><i>u</i></sub> - ρ|<i>u</i>| in the direction of
<i>u</i>, and C′<sub><i>ū</i></sub> in the directions <i>ū</i> perpendicular to <i>u</i> the
“Convection current.” This last vanishes for σ = 0.</p>

<p class='c005'>We remark that for ε = 1, μ = 1 the equations <i>e′</i> = E′,
<i>m′</i> = M′ immediately lead to the equations <i>e</i> = E, <i>m</i> = M
by means of a reciprocal Lorentz-transformation with -<i>u</i>
as vector; and for σ = 0, the equation C′ = 0 leads to C = ρ<i>u</i>;
that the fundamental equations of Äther discussed in <a href='#sect4-2'>§ 2</a>
becomes in fact the limitting case of the equations
obtained here with ε = 1, μ = 1, σ = 0.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>§ 9. The Fundamental Equations in Lorentz’s Theory.</h3>
<p class='c004'>Let us now see how far the fundamental equations
assumed by Lorentz correspond to the Relativity postulate,
as defined in <a href='#sect4-8'>§8</a>. In the article on Electron-theory (Ency.,
Math., Wiss., Bd. V. 2, Art 14) Lorentz has given the
fundamental equations for any possible, even magnetised
bodies (see there page 209, Eqn XXX′, formula (14) on
page 78 of the same (part).</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(III<i>a″</i>) Curl (H - [<i>u</i>E]) = J + <i>d</i>D/<i>dt</i> + <i>u</i> div D</div>

      <div class='line'>(IV″) curl E = - <i>d</i>B/<i>dt</i>, Div B = 0 (V′)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then for moving non-magnetised bodies, Lorentz puts
(page 223, 3) μ = 1, B = H, and in addition to that takes
account of the occurrence of the di-electric constant ε, and
conductivity σ according to equations</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>(ε<i>q</i>XXXIII′, p. 223) J = σ(E + [<i>u</i>B])</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Lorentz’s E, D, H are here denoted by E, M, <i>e</i>, <i>m</i>
while J denotes the conduction current.</p>

<p class='c005'>The three last equations which have been just cited
here coincide with eqn (II), (III), (IV), the first equation
would be, if J is identified with C, = <i>u</i>ρ (the current being
zero for σ = 0,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(29) Curl [H - (<i>u</i>, E)] = C + <i>d</i>D/<i>dt</i> - curl [<i>u</i>D],</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>and thus comes out to be in a different form than (1) here.
Therefore for magnetised bodies, Lorentz’s equations do not
correspond to the Relativity Principle.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the other hand, the form corresponding to the
relativity principle, for the condition of non-magnetisation
is to be taken out of (D) in <a href='#sect4-8'>§8</a>, with μ = 1, not as B = H,
as Lorentz takes, but as (30) B - [<i>u</i>D] = H - [<i>u</i>D]
(M - [<i>u</i>E] = <i>m</i> - [<i>ue</i>]. Now by putting H = B, the differential
equation (29) is transformed into the same form as
eqn (1) here when <i>m</i> - [<i>ue</i>] = M - [<i>u</i>E]. Therefore it so
happens that by a compensation of two contradictions to
the relativity principle, the differential equations of Lorentz
for moving non-magnetised bodies at last agree with the
relativity postulate.</p>

<p class='c005'>If we make use of (30) for non-magnetic bodies, and
put accordingly H = B + [<i>u</i>, (D - E)], then in consequence
of (C) in <a href='#sect4-8'>§8</a>,</p>

<p class='c010'><i>i.e.</i> it coincides with Lorentz’s assumption, if we neglect

<h3 class='c008'>§11. Typical Representations of the Fundamental Equations.</h3>
<p class='c004'>In the statement of the fundamental equations, our
leading idea had been that they should retain a covariance
of form, when subjected to a group of Lorentz-transformations.
Now we have to deal with ponderomotive
reactions and energy in the electro-magnetic field. Here
from the very first there can be no doubt that the
settlement of this question is in some way connected with
the simplest forms which can be given to the fundamental
equations, satisfying the conditions of covariance. In
order to arrive at such forms, I shall first of all put the
fundamental equations in a typical form which brings out
clearly their covariance in case of a Lorentz-transformation.
Here I am using a method of calculation, which enables us
to deal in a simple manner with the space-time vectors of
the 1st, and 2nd kind, and of which the rules, as far as
required are given below.</p>

<p class='c004'>It would be very unsatisfactory, if the new way of
looking at the time-concept, which permits a Lorentz
transformation, were to be confined to a single part of
Physics.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now many authors say that classical mechanics stand
in opposition to the relativity postulate, which is taken
to be the basis of the new Electro-dynamics.</p>

<p class='c005'>In order to decide this let us fix our attention upon a special
Lorentz transformation represented by (10), (11), (12),
with a vector <i>v</i> in any direction and of any magnitude <i>q</i> &lt; 1
but different from zero. For a moment we shall not suppose
any special relation to hold between the unit of length
and the unit of time, so that instead of <i>t</i>, <i>t′</i>, <i>q</i>, we shall
write <i>ct</i>, <i>ct′</i>, and <i>q</i>/<i>c</i>, where <i>c</i> represents a certain positive
constant, and <i>q</i>
is &lt;
<i>c</i>. The above mentioned equations
are transformed into</p>

transformation of expression (1) with a finite value of <i>c</i>,
in another part for <i>c</i> = ∞.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is evident that according to Newtonian Mechanics,
this covariance holds for <i>c</i> = ∞ and not for <i>c</i> = velocity of light.</p>

<p class='c005'>May we not then regard those traditional covariances
for <i>c</i> = ∞ only as an approximation consistent with
experience, the actual covariance of natural laws holding
for a certain finite value of <i>c</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I may here point out that by if instead of the Newtonian
Relativity-Postulate with <i>c</i> = ∞, we assume a relativity-postulate

<p class='c005'>To transform a space-time point P (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>) to rest is

known as the elementary contents (Inhalts-element) of the

cross-section normal to the <i>t</i> axis of the filament at the
point <i>t</i> = <i>t₀</i>, and the volume of the body R₀ is to be
regarded as the contents of the cross-section.</p>

<p class='c005'>If we allow R₀ to converge to a point, we come to the
conception of an infinitely thin space-time filament. In
such a case, a space-time line will be thought of as a

this principal line; under the term normal cross-section

<p class='c005'>We shall now formulate the principle of conservation

<p class='c005'>To every space R at a time <i>t</i>, belongs a positive

to a point (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>), then the quotient of this mass, and
the volume of R approaches a limit μ(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>), which is
known as the mass-density at the space-time point
(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>).</p>

<p class='c005'>The principle of conservation of mass says—that for
an infinitely thin space-time filament, the product μ<i>d</i>J,
where μ = mass-density at the point (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>) of the filament
(<i>i.e.</i>, the principal line of the filament), <i>d</i>J = contents
of the cross-section normal to the <i>t</i> axis, and passing
through (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>), is constant along the whole filament.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now the contents <i>d</i>J<sub>n</sub> of the normal cross-section of

<p class='c010'>may be defined as the rest-mass density at the position

be formulated in this manner:—</p>

<p class='c005'><i>For an infinitely thin space-time filament, the product

<p class='c005'>In any space-time filament, let us consider two cross-sections

the value λ; these magnitudes are then functions of (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>,

filament at the point (<i>x</i> <i>y</i> <i>z</i> <i>t</i>) with the normal section
of contents <i>d</i>J<sub><i>n</i></sub> and if <i>d</i>J<sub><i>n</i></sub> + δ<i>d</i>J<sub><i>n</i></sub> be the contents of the

of mass—(ν + <i>d</i>ν being the rest-mass-density at the varied

<p class='c010'>In consequence of this condition, the integral (7)

<p class='c005'>The set of four equations (22) again shows the symmetry

experience a moving force according to the following law.
Let us picture to ourselves the space-time filaments of F

BC be an infinitely small element of the principal line of
F; further let B* be the light point of B, C* be the
light point of C on the principal line of F*; so that
OA′ is the radius vector of the hyperboloidal fundamental
figure (23) parallel to B*C*, finally D* is the point of
intersection of line B*C* with the space normal to itself

another vector of suitable value in direction of B*C*.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now by (OA′/B*D*) is to be understood the ratio of the two
vectors in question. It is clear that this proposition at

<p class='c005'>Let us now ask how the space-time filament of F
behaves when the material point F* has a uniform
translatory motion, <i>i.e.</i>, the principal line of the filament

this, and by means of a Lorentz-transformation, we can
take this axis as the t-axis. Let <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>, denote the point

  <h2 class='c003'>SPACE AND TIME</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>A Lecture delivered before the Naturforscher Versammlung
(Congress of Natural Philosophers) at Cologne—(21st
September, 1908).</p>

<p class='c005'>Gentlemen,</p>

<p class='c005'>The conceptions about time and space, which I hope
to develop before you to-day, has grown on experimental
physical grounds. Herein lies its strength. The tendency
is radical. Henceforth, the old conception of space for
itself, and time for itself shall reduce to a mere shadow,
and some sort of union of the two will be found consistent
with facts.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>I</h3>
<p class='c004'>Now I want to show you how we can arrive at the
changed concepts about time and space from mechanics, as
accepted now-a-days, from purely mathematical considerations.
The equations of Newtonian mechanics show a twofold
invariance, (<i>i</i>) their form remains unaltered when
we subject the fundamental space-coordinate system to
any possible change of position, (<i>ii</i>) when we change the
system in its nature of motion, <i>i. e.</i>, when we impress upon
it any uniform motion of translation, the null-point of time
plays no part. We are accustomed to look upon the axioms
of geometry as settled once for all, while we seldom have the
same amount of conviction regarding the axioms of mechanics,
and therefore the two invariants are seldom mentioned
in the same breath. Each one of these denotes a certain
group of transformations for the differential equations of
mechanics. We look upon the existence of the first group
as a fundamental characteristics of space. We always
prefer to leave off the second group to itself, and with a
light heart conclude that we can never decide from physical
considerations whether the space, which is supposed to be
at rest, may not finally be in uniform motion. So these two
groups lead quite separate existences besides each other.
Their totally heterogeneous character may scare us away
from the attempt to compound them. Yet it is the whole
compounded group which as a whole gives us occasion for
thought.</p>

<p class='c005'>We wish to picture to ourselves the whole relation
graphically. Let (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>) be the rectangular coordinates of
space, and <i>t</i> denote the time. Subjects of our perception
are always connected with place and time. <i>No one has
observed a place except at a particular time, or has observed
a time except at a particular place.</i> Yet I respect the
dogma that time and space have independent existences. I
will call a space-point plus a time-point, <i>i.e.</i>, a system of
values <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>, as a <i>world-point</i>. The manifoldness of all
possible values of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>, will be the <i>world</i>. I can draw
four world-axes with the chalk. Now any axis drawn
consists of quickly vibrating molecules, and besides, takes
part in all the journeys of the earth ; and therefore gives
us occasion for reflection. The greater abstraction required
for the four-axes does not cause the mathematician any
trouble. In order not to allow any yawning gap to
exist, we shall suppose that at every place and time,
something perceptible exists. In order not to specify
either matter or electricity, we shall simply style these as
substances. We direct our attention to the <i>world-point</i>
<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>, and suppose that we are in a position to recognise
this substantial point at any subsequent time. Let <i>dt</i> be
the time element corresponding to the changes of space
coordinates of this point [<i>dx</i>, <i>dy</i>, <i>dz</i>]. Then we obtain (as
a picture, so to speak, of the perennial life-career of the
substantial point),—a curve in the <i>world</i>—the <i>world-line</i>,
the points on which unambiguously correspond to the parameter
<i>t</i> from +∞ to -∞. The whole world appears to be
resolved in such <i>world-lines</i>, and I may just deviate from
my point if I say that according to my opinion the physical
laws would find their fullest expression as mutual relations
among these lines.</p>

<p class='c005'>By this conception of time and space, the (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>) manifoldness
<i>t</i> = 0 and its two sides <i>t</i> &lt; 0 and <i>t</i> > 0 falls asunder.
If for the sake of simplicity, we keep the null-point of time
and space fixed, then the first named group of mechanics
signifies that at <i>t</i> = 0 we can give the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>-axes any
possible rotation about the null-point corresponding to the
homogeneous linear transformation of the expression</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>x²</i> + <i>y²</i> + <i>z²</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The second group denotes that without changing the
expression for the mechanical laws, we can substitute
(<i>x</i> - α<i>t</i>, <i>y</i> - β<i>t</i>,  <i>z</i> - γ<i>t</i> for (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>) where (α, β, γ) are any
constants. According to this we can give the time-axis
any possible direction in the upper half of the world <i>t</i> > 0.
Now what have the demands of orthogonality in space to
do with this perfect freedom of the time-axis towards the
upper half?</p>

<p class='c005'>To establish this connection, let us take a positive parameter
c, and let us consider the figure</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>c²</i><i>t²</i> - <i>x²</i> - <i>y²</i> - <i>z²</i> = 1</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>According to the analogy of the hyperboloid of two
sheets, this consists of two sheets separated by <i>t</i> = 0. Let us
consider the sheet, in the region of <i>t</i> > 0, and let us now
conceive the transformation of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i> in the new system
of variables; (<i>x’</i>, <i>y’</i>, <i>z’</i>, <i>t’</i>) by means of which the form of
the expression will remain unaltered. Clearly the rotation
of space round the null-point belongs to this group of
transformations. Now we can have a full idea of the transformations
which we picture to ourselves from a particular
transformation in which (<i>y</i>, <i>z</i>) remain unaltered. Let
us draw the cross section of the upper sheets with the
plane of the <i>x</i>- and <i>t</i>-axes, <i>i.e.</i>, the upper half of
the hyperbola <i>c²</i><i>t²</i> - x² = 1, with its asymptotes (<i>vide</i>
fig. 1).</p>

<p class='c005'>Then let us draw the radius rector OA′, the tangent
A′ B′ at A′, and let us complete the parallelogram OA′
B′ C′; also produce B′ C′ to meet the x-axis at D′.
Let us now take Ox′, OA′ as new axes with the unit measuring
rods OC′ = 1, OA′ = (1/c) ; then the hyperbola is again
expressed in the form <i>c²</i><i>t′²</i> - x′² = 1, t′ > 0  and the transition
from (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>) to (<i>x′</i> <i>y′</i> <i>z′</i> <i>t</i>) is one of the transitions in
question. Let us add to this characteristic transformation
any possible displacement of the space and time null-points;
then we get a group of transformation depending only on
<i>c</i>, which we may denote by G<sub><i>c</i></sub>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now let us increase <i>c</i> to infinity. Thus (1/c) becomes zero
and it appears from the figure that the hyperbola is gradually
shrunk into the <i>x</i>-axis, the asymptotic angle becomes
a straight one, and every special transformation in
the limit changes in such a manner that the <i>t</i>-axis can
have any possible direction upwards, and <i>x′</i> more and
more approximates to <i>x</i>. Remembering this point it is
clear that the full group belonging to Newtonian Mechanics
is simply the group G<sub><i>c</i></sub>, with the value of <i>c</i> = ∞. In this
state of affairs, and since G<sub><i>c</i></sub> is mathematically more intelligible
than G<sub>∞</sub>, a mathematician may, by a free play
of imagination, hit upon the thought that natural phenomena
possess an invariance not only for the group G<sub>∞</sub>,
but in fact also for a group G<sub><i>c</i></sub>, where <i>c</i> is finite, but yet
exceedingly large compared to the usual measuring units.
Such a preconception would be an extraordinary triumph
for pure mathematics.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the same time I shall remark for which value of <i>c</i>,
this invariance can be conclusively held to be true. <i>For c,
we shall substitute the velocity of light c in free space.</i>
In order to avoid speaking either of space or of vacuum,
we may take this quantity as the ratio between the electrostatic
and electro-magnetic units of electricity.</p>

<p class='c005'>We can form an idea of the invariant character of the
expression for natural laws for the group-transformation
G<sub><i>c</i></sub> in the following manner.</p>

<p class='c005'>Out of the totality of natural phenomena, we can, by
successive higher approximations, deduce a coordinate
system (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>); by means of this coordinate system, we
can represent the phenomena according to definite laws.
This system of reference is by no means uniquely determined
by the phenomena. <i>We can change the system of
reference in any possible manner corresponding to the above-mentioned
group transformation G<sub>c</sub>, but the expressions for
natural laws will not be changed thereby.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>For example, corresponding to the above described
figure, we can call <i>t′</i> the time, but then necessarily the
space connected with it must be expressed by the manifoldness
(<i>x′</i> <i>y</i> <i>z</i>). The physical laws are now expressed by
means of <i>x′</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t′</i>,—and the expressions are just the
same as in the case of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>. According to this, we
shall have in the world, not one space, but many spaces,—quite
analogous to the case that the three-dimensional
space consists of an infinite number of planes. The three-dimensional
geometry will be a chapter of four-dimensional
physics. Now you perceive, why I said in the beginning
that time and space shall reduce to mere shadows and we
shall have a world complete in itself.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>II</h3>
<p class='c004'>Now the question may be asked,—what circumstances
lead us to these changed views about time and space, are
they not in contradiction with observed phenomena, do
they finally guarantee us advantages for the description of
natural phenomena?</p>

<p class='c005'>Before we enter into the discussion, a very important
point must be noticed. Suppose we have individualised
time and space in any manner; then a world-line parallel
to the <i>t</i>-axis will correspond to a stationary point; a
world-line inclined to the <i>t</i>-axis will correspond to a
point moving uniformly; and a world-curve will correspond
to a point moving in any manner. Let us now picture
to our mind the world-line passing through any world
point <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>; now if we find the world-line parallel
to the radius vector OA′ of the hyperboloidal sheet, then
we can introduce OA′ as a new time-axis, and then
according to the new conceptions of time and space the
substance will appear to be at rest in the world point
concerned. We shall now introduce this fundamental
axiom:—</p>

<p class='c005'><i>The substance existing at any world point can always
be conceived to be at rest, if we establish our time and
space suitably.</i> The axiom denotes that in a world-point,
the expression</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>c²</i><i>dt²</i> - <i>dx²</i> - <i>dy²</i> - <i>dz²</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>shall always be positive or what is equivalent to the
same thing, every velocity V should be smaller than <i>c</i>.
<i>c</i> shall therefore be the upper limit for all substantial
velocities and herein lies a deep significance for the
quantity <i>c</i>. At the first impression, the axiom seems to
be rather unsatisfactory. It is to be remembered that
only a modified mechanics will occur, in which the square
root of this differential combination takes the place of
time, so that cases in which the velocity is greater than <i>c</i>
will play no part, something like imaginary coordinates
in geometry.</p>

<p class='c005'>The <i>impulse</i> and real cause of inducement <i>for the
assumption of the group-transformation G<sub>c</sub></i> is the fact that
the differential equation for the propagation of light in
vacant space possesses the group-transformation G<sub><i>c</i></sub>. On
the other hand, the idea of rigid bodies has any sense
only in a system mechanics with the group G<sub>infinity</sub>. Now
if we have an optics with G<sub><i>c</i></sub>, and on the other hand
if there are rigid bodies, it is easy to see that a
<i>t</i>-direction can be defined by the two hyperboloidal
shells common to the groups G<sub>∞</sub>, and G<sub><i>c</i></sub>, which has
got the further consequence, that by means of suitable
rigid instruments in the laboratory, we can perceive a
change in natural phenomena, in case of different orientations,
with regard to the direction of progressive motion
of the earth. But all efforts directed towards this
object, and even the celebrated interference-experiment
of Michelson have given negative results. In order to
supply an explanation for this result, H. A. Lorentz
formed a hypothesis which practically amounts to an
invariance of optics for the group G<sub><i>c</i></sub>. According to
Lorentz every substance shall suffer a contraction</p>

<p class='c005'>1:(√(1 - v²/<i>c²</i>)) in length, in the direction of its motion</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>l</i>/<i>l′</i> = 1/√(1 - <i>v²</i>/<i>c²</i>)  <i>l′</i> = <i>l</i>(1 - <i>v²</i>/<i>c²</i>).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This hypothesis sounds rather phantastical. For the
contraction is not to be thought of as a consequence of the
resistance of ether, but purely as a gift from the skies, as a
sort of condition always accompanying a state of motion.</p>

<p class='c005'>I shall show in our figure that Lorentz’s hypothesis
is fully equivalent to the new conceptions about time and
space. Thereby it may appear more intelligible. Let us
now, for the sake of simplicity, neglect (<i>y</i>, <i>z</i>) and fix our
attention on a two dimensional world, in which let upright
strips parallel to the <i>t</i>-axis represent a state of rest and
another parallel strip inclined to the <i>t</i>-axis represent a
state of uniform motion for a body, which has a constant
spatial extension (see fig. 1). If OA′ is parallel to the second
strip, we can take <i>t′</i> as the <i>t</i>-axis and <i>x′</i> as the <i>x</i>-axis, then
the second body will appear to be at rest, and the first body
in uniform motion. We shall now assume that the first
body supposed to be at rest, has the length <i>l</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the
cross section PP of the first strip upon the <i>x</i>-axis = <i>l</i><sup>.</sup> OC,
where OC is the unit measuring rod upon the <i>x</i>-axis—and
the second body also, when supposed to be at rest, has the
same length <i>l</i>, this means that, the cross section Q′Q′ of
the second strip has a cross-section <i>l</i><sup>·</sup> OC′, when measured
parallel to the <i>x′</i>-axis. In these two bodies, we have
now images of two Lorentz-electrons, one of which is at
rest and the other moves uniformly. Now if we stick
to our original coordinates, then the extension of the
second electron is given by the cross section QQ of the
strip belonging to it measured parallel to the <i>x</i>-axis.
Now it is clear since Q′Q′ = <i>l</i><sup>·</sup> OC′, that QQ = <i>l</i><sup>·</sup> OD′.</p>

<p class='c005'>If (<i>dc</i>/<i>dt</i>) = <i>v</i>, an easy calculation gives that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>OD′ = OC √(1-(<i>v²</i>/<i>c²</i>)), therefore (PP/QQ) = (1/√(1-(<i>v²</i>/<i>c²</i>))</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This is the sense of Lorentz’s hypothesis about the
contraction of electrons in case of motion. On the other
hand, if we conceive the second electron to be at rest,
and therefore adopt the system (<i>x′</i>, <i>t′</i>,) then the cross-section
P′P′ of the strip of the electron parallel to OC′ is to be
regarded as its length and we shall find the first electron
shortened with reference to the second in the same proportion,
for it is,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>P′P′/Q′Q′ = OD/OC′ = OD′/OC = QQ/PP</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Lorentz called the combination <i>t′</i> of (<i>t</i> and <i>x</i>) as the
<i>local time</i> (<i>Ortszeit</i>) of the uniformly moving electron, and
used a physical construction of this idea for a better comprehension
of the contraction-hypothesis. But to perceive
clearly that the time of an electron is as good as the time
of any other electron, <i>i.e.</i> <i>t</i>, <i>t′</i> are to be regarded as equivalent,
has been the service of A. Einstein [Ann. d.
Phys. 891, p. 1905, Jahrb. d. Radis. ... 4-4-11-1907.] There
the concept of time was shown to be completely and unambiguously
established by natural phenomena. But the
concept of space was not arrived at, either by Einstein
or Lorentz, probably because in the case of the above-mentioned
spatial transformations, where the (<i>x′</i>, <i>t′</i>) plane
coincides with the <i>x</i>-<i>t</i> plane, the significance is possible
that the <i>x</i>-axis of space some-how remains conserved in
its position.</p>

<p class='c005'>We can approach the idea of space in a corresponding
manner, though some may regard the attempt as rather
fantastical.</p>

<p class='c005'>According to these ideas, the word “Relativity-Postulate”
which has been coined for the demands of invariance
in the group G, seems to be rather inexpressive for a true
understanding of the group G<sub><i>c</i></sub>, and for further progress.
Because the sense of the postulate is that the four-dimensional
world is given in space and time by phenomena
only, but the projection in time and space can
be handled with a certain freedom, and therefore I would
rather like to give to this assertion the name “<i>The
Postulate of the Absolute world</i>” [World-Postulate].</p>
<h3 class='c008'>III</h3>
<p class='c004'>By the world-postulate a similar treatment of the four
determining quantities <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>, of a world-point is possible.
Thereby the forms under which the physical laws
come forth, gain in intelligibility, as I shall presently show.
Above all, the idea of acceleration becomes much more
striking and clear.</p>

<p class='c005'>I shall again use the geometrical method of expression.
Let us call any world-point O as a “Space-time-null-point.”
The cone</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>c²</i><i>t²</i> - <i>x²</i> - <i>y²</i> - <i>z²</i> = O</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>consists of two parts with O as apex, one part having
<i>t</i> &lt; 0, the other having <i>t</i> &gt; 0. The first, which we may call
<i>the fore-cone</i> consists of all those points which send light
towards O, the second, which we may call <i>the aft-cone</i>,
consists of all those points which receive their light from
O. The region bounded by the fore-cone may be called
the fore-side of O, and the region bounded by the aft-cone
may be called the aft-side of O. (<i>Vide</i> fig. 2).</p>

<p class='c005'>On the aft-side of O we have the already considered
hyperboloidal shell F = <i>c²</i><i>t²</i> - <i>x²</i> - <i>y²</i> - <i>z²</i> = 1, <i>t</i> > 0.</p>

<p class='c005'>The region inside the two cones will be occupied by the
hyperboloid of one sheet</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>-F = <i>x²</i> + <i>y²</i> + <i>z²</i> - <i>c²</i><i>t²</i> = <i>k²</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>where <i>k²</i> can have all possible positive values. The
hyperbolas which lie upon this figure with O as centre,
are important for us. For the sake of clearness the individual
branches of this hyperbola will be called the “<i>Inter-hyperbola
with centre O</i>.” Such a hyperbolic branch,
when thought of as a world-line, would represent a
motion which for <i>t</i> = -∞ and <i>t</i> = ∞, asymptotically
approaches the velocity of light <i>c</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>If, by way of analogy to the idea of vectors in space,
we call any directed length in the manifoldness <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i> a
vector, then we have to distinguish between a time-vector
directed from O towards the sheet ±F = 1, <i>t</i> > 0 and a
space-vector directed from O towards the sheet -F = 1.
The time-axis can be parallel to any vector of the first
kind. Any world-point between the <i>fore</i> and <i>aft cones</i>
of O, may by means of the system of reference be regarded
either as synchronous with O, as well as later or earlier
than O. Every world-point on the fore-side of O is
necessarily always earlier, every point on the aft side of
O, later than O. The limit <i>c</i> = ∞ corresponds to a complete
folding up of the wedge-shaped cross-section between
the fore and aft cones in the manifoldness <i>t</i> = 0. In the
figure drawn, this cross-section has been intentionally
drawn with a different breadth.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us decompose a vector drawn from O towards
(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>) into its components. If the directions of the two
vectors are respectively the directions of the radius vector
OR to one of the surfaces ±F = 1, and of a tangent RS
at the point R of the surface, then the vectors shall be
called normal to each other. Accordingly</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>c²</i><i>tt₁</i> - <i>xx₁</i> - <i>yy₁</i> - <i>zz₁</i> = 0,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>which is the condition that the vectors with the components
(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>) and (<i>x₁</i> <i>y₁</i> <i>z₁</i> <i>t₁</i>) are normal to each
other.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the <i>measurement</i> of vectors in different directions,
the unit measuring rod is to be fixed in the following
manner;—a space-like vector from 0 to -F = I is always
to have the measure unity, and a time-like vector from
O to +F = 1, <i>t</i> > 0 is always to have the measure 1/<i>c</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us now fix our attention upon the world-line of a
substantive point running through the world-point (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>,

<p class='c005'>Now there is, as can be easily seen, a certain hyperbola,
which has three infinitely contiguous points in common
with the world-line at P, and of which the asymptotes
are the generators of a ‘fore-cone’ and an ‘aft-cone.’
This hyperbola may be called the “hyperbola of curvature”
at P (<i>vide</i> fig. 3). If M be the centre of this hyperbola,
then we have to deal here with an ‘Inter-hyperbola’ with
centre M. Let P = measure of the vector MP, then we
easily perceive that the acceleration-vector at P is <i>a vector

<p class='c005'>If [..<i>x</i>], [..<i>y</i>], [..<i>z</i>], [..<i>t</i>] are nil, then the hyperbola of curvature

<p class='c004'>In order to demonstrate that the assumption of the
group G<sub><i>c</i></sub> for the physical laws does not possibly lead to
any contradiction, it is unnecessary to undertake a revision
of the whole of physics on the basis of the assumptions
underlying this group. The revision has already been
successfully made in the case of “Thermodynamics and
Radiation,”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c007'><sup>[30]</sup></a> for “Electromagnetic phenomena”,<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c007'><sup>[31]</sup></a> and
finally for “Mechanics with the maintenance of the idea of
mass.”</p>

<p class='c005'>For this last mentioned province of physics, the question
may be asked: if there is a force with the components

(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>), where the velocity-vector is ([.<i>x</i>], [.<i>y</i>], [.<i>z</i>], [.<i>t</i>]),
then how are we to regard this force when the system of
reference is changed in any possible manner? Now it is
known that there are certain well-tested theorems about
the ponderomotive force in electromagnetic fields, where
the group G<sub><i>c</i></sub> is undoubtedly permissible. These theorems
lead us to the following simple rule; <i>if the system of
reference be changed in any way, then the supposed force is
to be put as a force in the new space-coordinates in such a

</div>

<p class='c010'>This vector is always normal to the velocity-vector at P.
Such a force-vector, representing a force at P, may be
called a <i>moving force-vector at</i> P.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now the world-line passing through P will be described
by a substantial point with the constant <i>mechanical mass
m</i>. Let us call <i>m-times</i> the velocity-vector at P as the
<i>impulse-vector</i>, and <i>m-times</i> the acceleration-vector at P as
the <i>force-vector of motion</i>, at P. According to these
definitions, the following law tells us how the motion of
a point-mass takes place under any moving force-vector<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c007'><sup>[32]</sup></a>:</p>

<p class='c005'><i>The force-vector of motion is equal to the moving force-vector.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>This enunciation comprises four equations for the components
in the four directions, of which the fourth can be
deduced from the first three, because both of the above-mentioned
vectors are perpendicular to the velocity-vector.
From the definition of T, we see that the fourth simply
expresses the “Energy-law.” Accordingly <i>c²</i>-<i>times the
component of the impulse-vector in the direction of the
t-axis is</i> to be defined as <i>the kinetic-energy</i> of the point-mass.

<p class='c010'><i>i.e.</i>, if we deduct from this the additive constant <i>mc²</i>, we
obtain the expression ½ <i>mv²</i> of Newtonian-mechanics up to
magnitudes of <i>the order of</i> 1/<i>c²</i>. Hence it appears that <i>the
energy</i> depends <i>upon the system of reference</i>. But since the
<i>t</i>-axis can be laid in the direction of any time-like axis,
therefore the energy-law comprises, for any possible system
of reference, the whole system of equations of motion.
This fact retains its significance even in the limiting case

<p class='c004'>The advantages arising from the formulation of the
world-postulate are illustrated by nothing so strikingly
as by the expressions which tell us about the reactions
exerted by a point-charge moving in any manner according
to the Maxwell-Lorentz theory.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us conceive of the world-line of such an electron
with the charge (<i>e</i>), and let us introduce upon it the
“Proper-time” τ reckoned from any possible initial point.
In order to obtain the field caused by the electron at any
world-point P₁ let us construct the fore-cone belonging
to P₁ (<i>vide</i> fig. 4). Clearly this cuts the unlimited
world-line of the electron at a single point P, because these
directions are all time-like vectors. At P, let us draw the
tangent to the world-line, and let us draw from P₁ the
normal to this tangent. Let <i>r</i> be the measure of P₁Q.
According to the definition of a fore-cone, <i>r</i>/<i>e</i> is to be
reckoned as the measure of PQ. Now at the world-point P₁,
the vector-potential of the field excited by <i>e</i> is represented
by the vector in direction PQ, having the magnitude
<i>e</i>/<i>cr</i>, in its three space components along the <i>x</i>-, <i>y</i>-, <i>z</i>-axes;
the scalar-potential is represented by the component along
the <i>t</i>-axis. This is the elementary law found out by
A. Lienard, and E. Wiechert.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c007'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>If the field caused by the electron be described in the
above-mentioned way, then it will appear that the division
of the field into electric and magnetic forces is a relative
one, and depends upon the time-axis assumed; the two
forces considered together bears some analogy to the
force-screw in mechanics; the analogy is, however, imperfect.</p>

<p class='c005'>I shall now describe <i>the ponderomotive force which is
exerted by one moving electron upon another moving electron</i>.
Let us suppose that the world-line of a second point-electron
passes through the world-point P₁. Let us
determine P, Q, <i>r</i> as before, construct the middle-point M
of the hyperbola of curvature at P, and finally the normal
MN upon a line through P which is parallel to QP₁.
With P as the initial point, we shall establish a system
of reference in the following way: the <i>t</i>-axis will be laid
along PQ, the <i>x</i>-axis in the direction of QP₁. The <i>y</i>-axis
in the direction of MN, then the <i>z</i>-axis is automatically
determined, as it is normal to the <i>x</i>-, <i>y</i>-, <i>z</i>-axes. Let
[:<i>x</i>], [:<i>y</i>], [:<i>z</i>], [:<i>t</i>] be the acceleration-vector at P, [.<i>x</i>]₁, [.<i>y</i>]₁ [.<i>z</i>]₁, [.<i>t</i>]₁
be the velocity-vector at P₁. Then the force-vector exerted
by the first election <i>e</i>, (moving in any possible manner)
upon the second election <i>e</i>, (likewise moving in any

giving the elementary law about the ponderomotive
action of moving electric charges upon each other, then we
cannot but admit, that the relations which occur here
reveal the inner essence of full simplicity first in four
dimensions; but in three dimensions, they have very complicated
projections.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the mechanics reformed according to the world-postulate,
the disharmonies which have disturbed the
relations between Newtonian mechanics and modern
electrodynamics automatically disappear. I shall now consider
the position of the Newtonian law of attraction to
this postulate. I will assume that two point-masses <i>m</i> and
<i>m₁</i> describe their world-lines; a moving force-vector is
exercised by <i>m</i> upon <i>m₁</i>, and the expression is just the same
as in the case of the electron, only we have to write
+<i>mm₁</i> instead -<i>ee₁</i>. We shall consider only the special
case in which the acceleration-vector of <i>m</i> is always zero:
then <i>t</i> may be introduced in such a manner that <i>m</i> may be
regarded as fixed, the motion of <i>m</i> is now subjected to the
moving-force vector of <i>m</i> alone. If we now modify this
given vector by writing -([<sup>.</sup>]1/√(1-(<i>v</i>²/<i>c²</i>)) instead of [.<i>t</i>] ([.<i>t</i>] = 1 up
to magnitudes of the order (1[<sup>.</sup>]/<i>c²</i>)), then it appears that
Kepler’s laws hold good for the position (<i>x₁</i>, <i>y₁</i>, <i>z₁</i>), of
<i>m₁</i> at any time, only in place of the time <i>t₁</i>, we have to
write the proper time τ₁ of <i>m₁</i>. On the basis of this
simple remark, it can be seen that the proposed law of
attraction in combination with new mechanics is not less
suited for the explanation of astronomical phenomena than
the Newtonian law of attraction in combination with
Newtonian mechanics.</p>

<p class='c005'>Also the fundamental equations for electro-magnetic
processes in moving bodies are in accordance with the
world-postulate. I shall also show on a later occasion
that the deduction of these equations, as taught by
Lorentz, are by no means to be given up.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fact that the world-postulate holds without exception
is, I believe, the true essence of an electromagnetic
picture of the world; the idea first occurred to Lorentz, its
essence was first picked out by Einstein, and is now gradually
fully manifest. In course of time, the mathematical
consequences will be gradually deduced, and enough
suggestions will be forthcoming for the experimental
verification of the postulate; in this way even those, who
find it uncongenial, or even painful to give up the old,
time-honoured concepts, will be reconciled to the new ideas
of time and space,—in the prospect that they will lead to
pre-established harmony between pure mathematics and
physics.</p>

</div>
<p class='c004'>The theory which is sketched in the following pages
forms the most wide-going generalization conceivable of
what is at present known as “the theory of Relativity;”
this latter theory I differentiate from the former
“Special Relativity theory,” and suppose it to be known.
The generalization of the Relativity theory has been made
much easier through the form given to the special Relativity
theory by Minkowski, which mathematician was the
first to recognize clearly the formal equivalence of the space
like and time-like co-ordinates, and who made use of it in
the building up of the theory. The mathematical apparatus
useful for the general relativity theory, lay already complete
in the “Absolute Differential Calculus,” which were
based on the researches of Gauss, Riemann and Christoffel
on the non-Euclidean manifold, and which have been
shaped into a system by Ricci and Levi-civita, and already
applied to the problems of theoretical physics. I have in
part B of this communication developed in the simplest
and clearest manner, all the supposed mathematical
auxiliaries, not known to Physicists, which will be useful
for our purpose, so that, a study of the mathematical
literature is not necessary for an understanding of this
paper. Finally in this place I thank my friend Grossmann,
by whose help I was not only spared the study of the
mathematical literature pertinent to this subject, but who
also aided me in the researches on the field equations of
gravitation.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>A <br /> Principal considerations about the Postulate of Relativity.</h3>
<h4 class='c009'>§ 1. Remarks on the Special Relativity Theory.</h4>
<p class='c004'>The special relativity theory rests on the following
postulate which also holds valid for the Galileo-Newtonian
mechanics.</p>

<p class='c005'>If a co-ordinate system K be so chosen that when referred
to it, the physical laws hold in their simplest forms
these laws would be also valid when referred to another
system of co-ordinates K′ which is subjected to an uniform
translational motion relative to K. We call this postulate
“The Special Relativity Principle.” By the word special,
it is signified that the principle is limited to the case,
when K′ has <i>uniform translatory</i> motion with reference to
K, but the equivalence of K and K′ does not extend to the
case of non-uniform motion of K′ relative to K.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Special Relativity Theory does not differ from the
classical mechanics through the assumption of this postulate,
but only through the postulate of the constancy of
light-velocity in vacuum which, when combined with the
special relativity postulate, gives in a well-known way, the
relativity of synchronism as well as the Lorenz-transformation,
with all the relations between moving rigid bodies
and clocks.</p>

<p class='c005'>The modification which the theory of space and time
has undergone through the special relativity theory, is
indeed a profound one, but a weightier point remains
untouched. According to the special relativity theory, the
theorems of geometry are to be looked upon as the laws
about any possible relative positions of solid bodies at rest,
and more generally the theorems of kinematics, as theorems
which describe the relation between measurable bodies and
clocks. Consider two material points of a solid body at
rest; then according to these conceptions there corresponds
to these points a wholly definite extent of length,
independent of kind, position, orientation and time of the
body.</p>

<p class='c005'>Similarly let us consider two positions of the pointers of
a clock which is at rest with reference to a co-ordinate
system; then to these positions, there always corresponds,
a time-interval of a definite length, independent of time
and place. It would be soon shown that the general relativity
theory can not hold fast to this simple physical
significance of space and time.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>§ 2. About the reasons which explain the extension of the relativity-postulate.</h4>
<p class='c004'>To the classical mechanics (no less than) to the special
relativity theory, is attached an episteomological defect,
which was perhaps first cleanly pointed out by E. Mach.
We shall illustrate it by the following example; Let
two fluid bodies of equal kind and magnitude swim freely
in space at such a great distance from one another (and
from all other masses) that only that sort of gravitational
forces are to be taken into account which the parts of any
of these bodies exert upon each other. The distance of
the bodies from one another is invariable. The relative
motion of the different parts of each body is not to occur.
But each mass is seen to rotate by an observer at rest relative
to the other mass round the connecting line of the
masses with a constant angular velocity (definite relative
motion for both the masses). Now let us think that the
surfaces of both the bodies (S₁ and S₂) are measured
with the help of measuring rods (relatively at rest); it is
then found that the surface of S₁ is a sphere and the
surface of the other is an ellipsoid of rotation. We now
ask, why is this difference between the two bodies? An
answer to this question can only then be regarded as satisfactory
from the episteomological standpoint when the
thing adduced as the cause is an observable fact of experience.
The law of causality has the sense of a definite
statement about the world of experience only when
observable facts alone appear as causes and effects.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Newtonian mechanics does not give to this question
any satisfactory answer. For example, it says:—The laws
of mechanics hold true for a space R₁ relative to which
the body S₁ is at rest, not however for a space relative to
which S₂ is at rest.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Galiliean space, which is here introduced is however
only a purely imaginary cause, not an observable thing.
It is thus clear that the Newtonian mechanics does not,
in the case treated here, actually fulfil the requirements
of causality, but produces on the mind a fictitious complacency,
in that it makes responsible a <i>wholly imaginary
cause</i> R₁ for the different behaviours of the bodies S₁ and
S₂ which are actually observable.</p>

<p class='c005'>A satisfactory explanation to the question put forward
above can only be thus given:—that the physical system
composed of S₁ and S₂ shows for itself alone no conceivable
cause to which the different behaviour of S₁ and
S₂ can be attributed. The cause must thus lie outside the
system. We are therefore led to the conception that the
general laws of motion which determine specially the
forms of S₁ and S₂ must be of such a kind, that the
mechanical behaviour of S₁ and S₂ must be essentially
conditioned by the distant masses, which we had not
brought into the system considered. These distant masses,
(and their relative motion as regards the bodies under consideration)
are then to be looked upon as the seat of the
principal observable causes for the different behaviours
of the bodies under consideration. They take the place
of the imaginary cause R₁. Among all the conceivable
spaces R₁ and R₂ moving in any manner relative to one
another, there is a priori, no one set which can be regarded
as affording greater advantages, against which the objection
which was already raised from the standpoint of the
theory of knowledge cannot be again revived. The laws
of physics must be so constituted that they should remain
valid for any system of co-ordinates moving in any manner.
We thus arrive at an extension of the relativity postulate.</p>

<p class='c005'>Besides this momentous episteomological argument,
there is also a well-known physical fact which speaks in
favour of an extension of the relativity theory. Let there
be a Galiliean co-ordinate system K relative to which (at
least in the four-dimensional region considered) a mass at
a sufficient distance from other masses move uniformly in
a line. Let K′ be a second co-ordinate system which has
a uniformly accelerated motion relative to K. Relative to
K′ any mass at a sufficiently great distance experiences
an accelerated motion such that its acceleration and the
direction of acceleration is independent of its material composition
and its physical conditions.</p>

<p class='c005'>Can any observer, at rest relative to K′, then conclude
that he is in an actually accelerated reference-system?
This is to be answered in the negative; the above-named
behaviour of the freely moving masses relative to K′ can
be explained in as good a manner in the following way.
The reference-system K′ has no acceleration. In the space-time
region considered there is a gravitation-field which
generates the accelerated motion relative to K′.</p>

<p class='c005'>This conception is feasible, because to us the experience
of the existence of a field of force (namely the gravitation
field) has shown that it possesses the remarkable property
of imparting the same acceleration to all bodies. The
mechanical behaviour of the bodies relative to K′ is the
same as experience would expect of them with reference
to systems which we assume from habit as stationary;
thus it explains why from the physical stand-point it can
be assumed that the systems K and K′ can both with the
same legitimacy be taken as at rest, that is, they will be
equivalent as systems of reference for a description of
physical phenomena.</p>

<p class='c005'>From these discussions we see, that the working out
of the general relativity theory must, at the same time,
lead to a theory of gravitation; for we can “create”
a gravitational field by a simple variation of the co-ordinate
system. Also we see immediately that the principle
of the constancy of light-velocity must be modified,
for we recognise easily that the path of a ray of light
with reference to K′ must be, in general, curved, when
light travels with a definite and constant velocity in a
straight line with reference to K.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>§ 3. The time-space continuum. Requirements of the general Co-variance for the equations expressing the laws of Nature in general.</h4>
<p class='c004'>In the classical mechanics as well as in the special
relativity theory, the co-ordinates of time and space have
an immediate physical significance; when we say that
any arbitrary point has <i>x₁</i> as its X₁ co-ordinate, it signifies
that the projection of the point-event on the X₁-axis
<i>ascertained</i> by means of a solid rod according to the rules
of Euclidean Geometry is reached when a definite measuring
rod, the unit rod, can be carried <i>x₁</i> times from the
origin of co-ordinates along the X₁ axis. A point having
<i>x₄</i> = <i>t₁</i> as the X₄ co-ordinate signifies that a unit clock
which is adjusted to be at rest relative to the system of
co-ordinates, and coinciding in its spatial position with the
point-event and set according to some definite standard has
gone over <i>x₄</i> = <i>t</i> periods before the occurrence of the
point-event.</p>

<p class='c005'>This conception of time and space is continually present
in the mind of the physicist, though often in an unconscious
way, as is clearly recognised from the role which this
conception has played in physical measurements. This
conception must also appear to the reader to be lying at
the basis of the second consideration of the last paragraph
and imparting a sense to these conceptions. But
we wish to show that we are to abandon it and in general
to replace it by more general conceptions in order to be
able to work out thoroughly the postulate of general relativity,—the
case of special relativity appearing as a limiting
case when there is no gravitation.</p>

<p class='c005'>We introduce in a space, which is free from Gravitation-field,
a Galiliean Co-ordinate System K (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>) and
also, another system K′ (<i>x′</i> <i>y′</i> <i>z′</i> <i>t′</i>) rotating uniformly relative
to K. The origin of both the systems as well as their
<i>z</i>-axes might continue to coincide. We will show that for
a space-time measurement in the system K′, the above
established rules for the physical significance of time and
space can not be maintained. On grounds of symmetry
it is clear that a circle round the origin in the XY plane
of K, can also be looked upon as a circle in the plane
(X′, Y′) of K′. Let us now think of measuring the circumference
and the diameter of these circles, with a unit
measuring rod (infinitely small compared with the radius)
and take the quotient of both the results of measurement.
If this experiment be carried out with a measuring rod
at rest relatively to the Galiliean system K we would get
π, as the quotient. The result of measurement with a rod
relatively at rest as regards K′ would be a number which
is greater than π. This can be seen easily when we
regard the whole measurement-process from the system K
and remember that the rod placed on the periphery
suffers a Lorenz-contraction, not however when the rod
is placed along the radius. Euclidean Geometry therefore
does not hold for the system K′; the above fixed conceptions
of co-ordinates which assume the validity of
Euclidean Geometry fail with regard to the system K′.
We cannot similarly introduce in K′ a time corresponding to
physical requirements, which will be shown by all similarly
prepared clocks at rest relative to the system K′. In order
to see this we suppose that two similarly made clocks are
arranged one at the centre and one at the periphery of
the circle, and considered from the stationary system
K. According to the well-known results of the special
relativity theory it follows—(as viewed from K)—that the
clock placed at the periphery will go slower than the
second one which is at rest. The observer at the common
origin of co-ordinates who is able to see the clock at the
periphery by means of light will see the clock at the
periphery going slower than the clock beside him. Since he
cannot allow the velocity of light to depend explicitly upon
the time in the way under consideration he will interpret
his observation by saying that the clock on the periphery
actually goes slower than the clock at the origin. He
cannot therefore do otherwise than define time in such
a way that the rate of going of a clock depends on its
position.</p>

<p class='c005'>We therefore arrive at this result. In the general
relativity theory time and space magnitudes cannot be so
defined that the difference in spatial co-ordinates can be
immediately measured by the unit-measuring rod, and time-like
co-ordinate difference with the aid of a normal clock.</p>

<p class='c005'>The means hitherto at our disposal, for placing our
co-ordinate system in the time-space continuum, in a
definite way, therefore completely fail and it appears that
there is no other way which will enable us to fit the
co-ordinate system to the four-dimensional world in such
a way, that by it we can expect to get a specially simple
formulation of the laws of Nature. So that nothing remains
for us but to regard all conceivable co-ordinate systems
as equally suitable for the description of natural phenomena.
This amounts to the following law:—</p>

<p class='c005'><i>That in general, Laws of Nature are expressed by means of
equations which are valid for all co-ordinate systems, that is,
which are covariant for all possible transformations.</i> It is
clear that a physics which satisfies this postulate will be
unobjectionable from the standpoint of the general
relativity postulate. Because among all substitutions
there are, in every case, contained those, which correspond
to all relative motions of the co-ordinate system (in
three dimensions). This condition of general covariance
which takes away the last remnants of physical objectivity
from space and time, is a natural requirement, as seen
from the following considerations. All our <i>well-substantiated</i>
space-time propositions amount to the determination
of space-time coincidences. If, for example, the event
consisted in the motion of material points, then, for this
last case, nothing else are really observable except the
encounters between two or more of these material points.
The results of our measurements are nothing else than
well-proved theorems about such coincidences of material
points, of our measuring rods with other material points,
coincidences between the hands of a clock, dial-marks and
point-events occurring at the same position and at the same
time.</p>

<p class='c005'>The introduction of a system of co-ordinates serves no
other purpose than an easy description of totality of such
coincidences. We fit to the world our space-time variables
(<i>x₁</i> <i>x₂</i> <i>x₃</i> <i>x₄</i>) such that to any and every point-event
corresponds a system of values of (<i>x₁</i> <i>x₂</i> <i>x₃</i> <i>x₄</i>). Two coincident
point-events correspond to the same value of the
variables (<i>x₁</i> <i>x₂</i> <i>x₃</i> <i>x₄</i>); <i>i.e.</i>, the coincidence is characterised
by the equality of the co-ordinates. If we now
introduce any four functions (<i>x′₁</i> <i>x′₂</i> <i>x′₃</i> <i>x′₄</i>) as co-ordinates,
so that there is an unique correspondence between
them, the equality of all the four co-ordinates in the new
system will still be the expression of the space-time
coincidence of two material points. As the purpose of
all physical laws is to allow us to remember such coincidences,
there is a priori no reason present, to prefer a
certain co-ordinate system to another; <i>i.e.</i>, we get the
condition of general covariance.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>§ 4. Relation of four co-ordinates to spatial and time-like measurements.</h4>
<p class='c004'><i>Analytical expression for the Gravitation-field.</i></p>
<p class='c004'>I am not trying in this communication to deduce the
general Relativity-theory as the simplest logical system
possible, with a minimum of axioms. But it is my chief
aim to develop the theory in such a manner that the
reader perceives the psychological naturalness of the way
proposed, and the fundamental assumptions appear to be
most reasonable according to the light of experience. In
this sense, we shall now introduce the following supposition;
that for an infinitely small four-dimensional region, the
relativity theory is valid in the special sense when the axes
are suitably chosen.</p>

<p class='c005'>The nature of acceleration of an infinitely small (positional)
co-ordinate system is hereby to be so chosen, that
the gravitational field does not appear; this is possible for
an infinitely small region. X₁, X₂, X₃ are the spatial
co-ordinates; X₄ is the corresponding time-co-ordinate
measured by some suitable measuring clock. These co-ordinates
have, with a given orientation of the system, an
immediate physical significance in the sense of the special
relativity theory (when we take a rigid rod as our unit of
measure). The expression</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>had then, according to the special relativity theory, a value
which may be obtained by space-time measurement, and
which is independent of the orientation of the local
co-ordinate system. Let us take <i>ds</i> as the magnitude of the
line-element belonging to two infinitely near points in the
four-dimensional region. If <i>ds²</i> belonging to the element
(<i>d</i>X₁, <i>d</i>X₂, <i>d</i>X₃, <i>d</i>X₄) be positive we call it with Minkowski,
time-like, and in the contrary case space-like.</p>

<p class='c005'>To the line-element considered, <i>i.e.</i>, to both the infinitely
near point-events belong also definite differentials
<i>dx₁</i>, <i>dx₂</i>, <i>dx₃</i>, <i>dx₄</i>, of the four-dimensional co-ordinates of
any chosen system of reference. If there be also a local
system of the above kind given for the case under consideration,
<i>d</i>X’s would then be represented by definite linear
homogeneous expressions of the form</p>

<p class='c010'>If we substitute the expression in (1) we get</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(3) <i>ds²</i> = σ<sub>στ</sub><i>g</i><sub>στ</sub><i>dx</i><sub>σ</sub><i>dx</i><sub>τ</sub></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>where <i>g</i><sub>στ</sub> will be functions of <i>x</i><sub>σ</sub>, but will no longer depend
upon the orientation and motion of the ‘local’ co-ordinates;
for <i>ds²</i> is a definite magnitude belonging to two point-events
infinitely near in space and time and can be got by
measurements with rods and clocks. The <i>g</i><sub>τσ</sub>’s are here to
be so chosen, that <i>g</i><sub>τσ</sub> = <i>g</i><sub>στ</sub>; the summation is to be
extended over all values of σ and τ, so that the sum is to
be extended, over 4 × 4 terms, of which 12 are equal in
pairs.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the method adopted here, the case of the usual
relativity theory comes out when owing to the special
behaviour of <i>g</i><sub>στ</sub> in a <i>finite</i> region it is possible to choose the
system of co-ordinates in such a way that <i>g</i><sub>στ</sub> assumes
constant values—</p>

      <div class='line in6'>{  0  0  0 +1</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>We would afterwards see that the choice of such a system
of co-ordinates for a finite region is in general not possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the considerations in § 2 and § 3 it is clear,
that from the physical stand-point the quantities <i>g</i><sub>στ</sub> are to
be looked upon as magnitudes which describe the gravitation-field
with reference to the chosen system of axes.
We assume firstly, that in a certain four-dimensional
region considered, the special relativity theory is true for
some particular choice of co-ordinates. The <i>g</i><sub>στ</sub>’s then
have the values given in (4). A free material point moves
with reference to such a system uniformly in a straight-line.
If we now introduce, by any substitution, the space-time
co-ordinates <i>x₁</i>...<i>x₄</i> then in the new system <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s are
no longer constants, but functions of space and time. At
the same time, the motion of a free point-mass in the new
co-ordinates, will appear as curvilinear, and not uniform, in
which the law of motion, will be <i>independent of the
nature of the moving mass-points</i>. We can thus signify this
motion as one under the influence of a gravitation field.
We see that the appearance of a gravitation-field is connected
with space-time variability of <i>g</i><sub>στ</sub>’s. In the general
case, we can not by any suitable choice of axes, make
special relativity theory valid throughout any finite region.
We thus deduce the conception that <i>g</i><sub>στ</sub>’s describe the
gravitational field. According to the general relativity
theory, gravitation thus plays an exceptional rôle as distinguished
from the others, specially the electromagnetic
forces, in as much as the 10 functions <i>g</i><sub>στ</sub> representing
gravitation, define immediately the metrical properties of
the four-dimensional region.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>B <br /> Mathematical Auxiliaries for Establishing the General Covariant Equations.</h3>
<p class='c004'>We have seen before that the general relativity-postulate
leads to the condition that the system of equations
for Physics, must be co-variants for any possible substitution
of co-ordinates <i>x₁</i>, ... <i>x₄</i>; we have now to see
how such general co-variant equations can be obtained.
We shall now turn our attention to these purely mathematical
propositions. It will be shown that in the solution, the
invariant <i>ds</i>, given in equation (3) plays a fundamental
rôle, which we, following Gauss’s Theory of Surfaces,
style as the line-element.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fundamental idea of the general co-variant theory
is this:—With reference to any co-ordinate system, let
certain things (tensors) be defined by a number of functions
of co-ordinates which are called the components of
the tensor. There are now certain rules according to which
the components can be calculated in a new system of
co-ordinates, when these are known for the original
system, and when the transformation connecting the two
systems is known. The things herefrom designated as
“Tensors” have further the property that the transformation
equation of their components are linear and homogeneous;
so that all the components in the new system vanish
if they are all zero in the original system. Thus a law
of Nature can be formulated by putting all the components
of a tensor equal to zero so that it is a general co-variant
equation; thus while we seek the laws of formation of
the tensors, we also reach the means of establishing general
co-variant laws.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>5. Contra-variant and co-variant Four-vector.</h4>
<p class='c004'>Contra-variant Four-vector. The line-element is defined

within the sign of summation [for example ν in (5)] are
those over which the summation is to be made and that
only over the indices which appear twice. It is therefore
possible, without loss of clearness, to leave off the summation
sign; so that we introduce the rule: wherever the
index in any term of an expression appears twice, it is to
be summed over all of them except when it is not expressedly
said to the contrary.</p>

<p class='c005'>The difference between the co-variant and the contra-variant
four-vector lies in the transformation laws [(7)

<p class='c005'>We call a thing which, with reference to any reference

<p class='c004'><i>Outer multiplication of Tensors</i>:—We get from the
components of a tensor of rank <i>z</i>, and another of a rank
<i>z′</i>, the components of a tensor of rank (<i>z</i> + <i>z′</i>) for which
we multiply all the components of the first with all the
components of the second in pairs. For example, we
obtain the tensor Τ from the tensors A and B of different
kinds:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>

<p class='c010'>The proof of the tensor character of Τ, follows immediately
from the expressions (8), (10) or (12), or the
transformation equations (9), (11), (13); equations (8),
(10) and (12) are themselves examples of the outer
multiplication of tensors of the first rank.</p>
<p class='c004'><i>Reduction in rank of a mixed Tensor.</i></p>
<p class='c004'>From every mixed tensor we can get a tensor which is
two ranks lower, when we put an index of co-variant
character equal to an index of the contravariant character
and sum according to these indices (Reduction). We get
for example, out of the mixed tensor of the fourth rank
A<sub>αβ</sub><sup>γδ</sup>,
the mixed tensor of the second rank</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>

<p class='c010'>The proof that the result of reduction retains a truly
tensorial character, follows either from the representation
of tensor according to the generalisation of (12) in combination
with (6) or out of the generalisation of (13).</p>
<p class='c004'><i>Inner and mixed multiplication of Tensors.</i></p>
<p class='c004'>This consists in the combination of outer multiplication
with reduction. Examples:—From the co-variant tensor of
the second rank A<sub>μν</sub> and the contravariant tensor of

B<sup>σ</sup>
we get by outer multiplication the

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>D<sup>σ</sup><sub>μν</sub> = A<sub>μν</sub> B<sup>σ</sup> .</div>

<p class='c010'>Through reduction according to indices ν and σ (<i>i.e.</i>, putting

<p class='c010'>These we denote as the inner product of the tensor
A<sub>μν</sub> and B<sup>σ</sup>. Similarly we get from the tensors A<sub>μν</sub> and B<sup>στ</sup>
through outer multiplication and two-fold reduction the
inner product
A<sub>μν</sub> B<sup>μν</sup>.
Through outer multiplication
and one-fold reduction we get out of
A<sub>μν</sub> and B<sup>στ</sup>,
the
mixed tensor of the second rank
D<sup>τ</sup><sub>μ</sub> = A<sub>μν</sub> B<sup>τν</sup>.
We
can fitly call this operation a mixed one; for it is outer
with reference to the indices μ and τ and inner with
respect to the indices ν and σ.</p>

<p class='c005'>We now prove a law, which will be often applicable for
proving the tensor-character of certain quantities. According
to the above representation,
A<sub>μν</sub> B<sup>μν</sup> is a scalar, when A<sub>μν</sub> and B<sup>στ</sup>
are tensors. We also remark that when
A<sub>μν</sub> B<sup>μν</sup> is
an invariant for every choice of the tensor
B<sup>μν</sup>, then A<sub>μν</sub>
has a tensorial character.</p>

<p class='c005'>Proof:—According to the above assumption, for any
substitution we have</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A<sub>στ′</sub>  B<sup>στ′</sup> = A<sub>μν</sub> B<sup>μν</sup>.</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/form-066.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>Substitution of this for
B<sup>μν</sup>
in the above equation gives</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/form-067.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>This can be true, for any choice of
B<sup>στ′</sup>
only when
the term within the bracket vanishes. From which by
referring to (11), the theorem at once follows. This law
correspondingly holds for tensors of any rank and character.
The proof is quite similar. The law can also be put in the
following form. If
B<sup>μ</sup> and C<sup>ν</sup> are any two vectors, and
if for every choice of them the inner product
A<sub>μν</sub> B<sup>μ</sup> C<sup>ν</sup>
is a scalar, then A<sub>μν</sub> is a co-variant tensor. The last
law holds even when there is the more special formulation,
that with any arbitrary choice of the four-vector
B<sup>μ</sup> alone the scalar product A<sub>μν</sub> B<sup>μ</sup> B<sup>ν</sup>
is a scalar, in which case
we have the additional condition that A<sub>μν</sub> satisfies the
symmetry condition. According to the method given
above, we prove the tensor character of (A<sub>μν</sub> + A<sub>νμ</sub>), from
which on account of symmetry follows the tensor-character
of A<sub>μν</sub>. This law can easily be generalized in the case of
co-variant and contravariant tensors of any rank.</p>

<p class='c005'>Finally, from what has been proved, we can deduce the
following law which can be easily generalized for any kind
of tensor: If the quantities A<sub>μν</sub> B<sup>ν</sup> form a tensor of the first rank, when B<sup>ν</sup>
is any arbitrarily chosen four-vector,
then A<sub>μν</sub> is a tensor of the second rank. If for example,
C<sup>μ</sup> is any four-vector, then owing to the tensor character of A<sub>μν</sub> B<sup>ν</sup>,
the inner product A<sub>μν</sub> C<sup>μ</sup> B<sup>ν</sup> is a scalar,
both the four-vectors C<sup>μ</sup> and B<sup>ν</sup> being arbitrarily chosen.
Hence the proposition follows at once.</p>

equal in magnitude to the four-dimensional volume-element
measured with solid rods and clocks, in accordance with
the special relativity theory.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Remarks on the character of the space-time continuum</i>—Our
assumption that in an infinitely small region the
special relativity theory holds, leads us to conclude that <i>ds²</i>
can always, according to (1) be expressed in real magnitudes

element <i>d</i>X₁ <i>d</i>X₂ <i>d</i>X₃ <i>d</i>X₄ we have thus (18a) <i>d</i>τ₀
= √(<i>g</i>)<i>i</i>τ.</p>

<p class='c005'>Should √(-<i>g</i>) vanish at any point of the four-dimensional
continuum it would signify that to a finite co-ordinate
volume at the place corresponds an infinitely small
“natural volume.” This can never be the case; so that <i>g</i>
can never change its sign; we would, according to the special
relativity theory assume that <i>g</i> has a finite negative
value. It is a hypothesis about the physical nature of the
continuum considered, and also a pre-established rule for
the choice of co-ordinates.</p>

<p class='c005'>If however (-<i>g</i>) remains positive and finite, it is
clear that the choice of co-ordinates can be so made that
this quantity becomes equal to one. We would afterwards
see that such a limitation of the choice of co-ordinates
would produce a significant simplification in expressions
for laws of nature.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let λ, be a function of the co-ordinates <i>x</i><sub>ν</sub>; this
defines a series of surfaces which cut the geodetic line

value of its co-ordinates <i>x</i><sub>ν</sub> are given in terms of λ. The
sign δ corresponds to a passage from a point of the

<p class='c004'>Relying on the equation of the geodetic line, we can
now easily deduce laws according to which new tensors can
be formed from given tensors by differentiation. For this
purpose, we would first establish the general co-variant
differential equations. We achieve this through a repeated
application of the following simple law. If a certain
curve be given in our continuum whose points are characterised
by the arc-distances <i>s</i>, measured from a fixed point on
the curve, and if further φ, be an invariant space function,
then  <i>d</i>φ/<i>ds</i> is also an invariant. The proof follows from
the fact that <i>d</i>φ as well as <i>ds</i>, are both invariants</p>

<p class='c005'>Since</p>

<p class='c005'>is also an invariant for all curves
which go out from a point in the continuum, <i>i.e.</i>, for

<p class='c005'>According to our law, the differential-quotient χ = ∂ψ/∂<i>s</i>

<p class='c005'>Here however we can not at once deduce the existence
of any tensor. If we however take that the curves along

<p class='c005'>We call the tensor A<sub>μν</sub> the “extension” of the tensor

ψ (<i>d</i>φ/∂<i>x</i><sub>μ</sub>) is a co-variant four-vector when ψ and φ are

alone. It is found easily. We put in (27) instead of
any tensor A<sup>μν</sup> the fundamental tensor <i>g</i><sup>μν</sup> and get from

<p class='c005'>The essential thing in this result is that on the

- A<sub>μτσ</sub>, and from the fact that A<sub>ρ</sub> is an arbitrary four
vector, it follows, on account of the result of §7, that
B<sup>ρ</sup><sub>μστ</sub>
is a tensor (Riemann-Christoffel Tensor).</p>

<p class='c005'>The mathematical significance of this tensor is as
follows; when the continuum is so shaped, that there is a

<p class='c005'>If we choose instead of the original co-ordinate system
any new one, so would the <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s referred to this last system

shows us, however, that these components vanish collectively
also in any other chosen system of reference. The
vanishing of the Riemann Tensor is thus a necessary condition
that for some choice of the axis-system <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s can be
taken as constants. In our problem it corresponds to the
case when by a suitable choice of the co-ordinate system,
the special relativity theory holds throughout any finite

that the co-ordinates can with advantage be so chosen that

paragraphs shows that, through such a choice, the law of
formation of the tensors suffers a significant simplification.
It is specially true for the tensor B<sub>μν</sub>, which plays
a fundamental rôle in the theory. By this simplification,
S<sub>μν</sub> vanishes of itself so that tensor B<sub>μν</sub> reduces to
R<sub>μν</sub>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I shall give in the following pages all relations in the
simplified form, with the above-named specialisation of
the co-ordinates. It is then very easy to go back to the
general covariant equations, if it appears desirable in
any special case.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>C. THE THEORY OF THE GRAVITATION-FIELD</h3>
<h4 class='c009'>§13. Equation of motion of a material point in a gravitation-field. Expression for the field-components of gravitation.</h4>
<p class='c004'>A freely moving body not acted on by external forces
moves, according to the special relativity theory, along a
straight line and uniformly. This also holds for the
generalised relativity theory for any part of the four-dimensional
region, in which the co-ordinates K<sub>0</sub> can be, and
are, so chosen that <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s have special constant values of
the expression (4).</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us discuss this motion from the stand-point of any
arbitrary co-ordinate-system K₁; it moves with reference to
K₁ (as explained in §2) in a gravitational field. The laws
of motion with reference to K₁ follow easily from the
following consideration. With reference to K₀, the law
of motion is a four-dimensional straight line and thus a
geodesic. As a geodetic-line is defined independently
of the system of co-ordinates, it would also be the law of
motion for the motion of the material-point with reference
to K₁. If we put</p>

<div class='ic007'>
<p>"(46)"</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>We now make the very simple assumption that this
general covariant system of equations defines also the
motion of the point in the gravitational field, when there
exists no reference-system K₀, with reference to which
the special relativity theory holds throughout a finite
region. The assumption seems to us to be all the more
legitimate, as (46) contains only the first differentials of
<i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>, among which there is no relation in the special case
when K₀ exists.</p>

<p class='c005'>If
γ<sub>μν</sub><sup>τ</sup>’s
vanish, the point moves uniformly and in a
straight line; these magnitudes therefore determine the
deviation from uniformity. They are the components of
the gravitational field.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>§14. The Field-equation of Gravitation in the absence of matter.</h4>
<p class='c004'>In the following, we differentiate gravitation-field from
matter in the sense that everything besides the gravitation-field
will be signified as matter; therefore the term
includes not only matter in the usual sense, but also the
electro-dynamic field. Our next problem is to seek the
field-equations of gravitation in the absence of matter. For
this we apply the same method as employed in the foregoing
paragraph for the deduction of the equations of
motion for material points. A special case in which the
field-equations sought-for are evidently satisfied is that of
the special relativity theory in which <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s have certain
constant values. This would be the case in a certain
finite region with reference to a definite co-ordinate
system K₀. With reference to this system, all the components
B<sup>ρ</sup><sub>μστ</sub>
of the Riemann’s Tensor [equation 43]
vanish. These vanish then also in the region considered,
with reference to every other co-ordinate system.</p>

<p class='c005'>The equations of the gravitation-field free from matter
must thus be in every case satisfied when all
B<sup>ρ</sup><sub>μστ</sub> vanish.
But this condition is clearly one which goes too far. For
it is clear that the gravitation-field generated by a material
point in its own neighbourhood can never be transformed
<i>away</i> by any choice of axes, <i>i.e.</i>, it cannot be transformed
to a case of constant <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s.</p>

<p class='c005'>Therefore it is clear that, for a gravitational field free
from matter, it is desirable that the symmetrical tensors
B<sub>μν</sub> deduced from the tensors
B<sup>ρ</sup><sub>μστ</sub>
should vanish.
We thus get 10 equations for 10 quantities <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub> which are
fulfilled in the special case when
B<sup>ρ</sup><sub>μστ</sub>’s
all vanish.</p>

<p class='c005'>Remembering (44) we see that in absence of matter
the field-equations come out as follows; (when referred

<p class='c005'>It can also be shown that the choice of these equations

than the second, and which is also linear in them.</p>

<p class='c005'>It will be shown that the equations arising in a purely
mathematical way out of the conditions of the general
relativity, together with equations (46), give us the Newtonian
law of attraction as a first approximation, and lead
in the second approximation to the explanation of the
perihelion-motion of mercury discovered by Leverrier
(the residual effect which could not be accounted for by
the consideration of all sorts of disturbing factors). My
view is that these are convincing proofs of the physical
correctness of my theory.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>§15. Hamiltonian Function for the Gravitation-field. <br /> Laws of Impulse and Energy.</h4>
<p class='c004'>In order to show that the field equations correspond to
the laws of impulse and energy, it is most convenient to
write it in the following Hamiltonian form:—</p>

<p class='c010'>Here the variations vanish at the limits of the finite
four-dimensional integration-space considered.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is first necessary to show that the form (47a) is
equivalent to equations (47). For this purpose, let us
consider H as a function of
<i>g</i><sup>μν</sup> and <i>g</i><sup>μν</sup><sub>σ</sub> (= ∂<i>g</i><sup>μν</sup>/∂<i>x</i><sub>σ</sub>)</p>

<p class='c005'>The terms arising out of the two last terms within the

<h4 class='c009'>§16. General formulation of the field-equation of Gravitation.</h4>
<p class='c004'>The field-equations established in the preceding paragraph
for spaces free from matter is to be compared with
the equation ▽²φ = 0 of the Newtonian theory. We have
now to find the equations which will correspond to
Poisson’s Equation ▽²φ = 4πκρ (ρ signifies the density of
matter).</p>

<p class='c005'>The special relativity theory has led to the conception
that the inertial mass (Träge Masse) is no other than
energy. It can also be fully expressed mathematically by
a symmetrical tensor of the second rank, the energy-tensor.
We have therefore to introduce in our generalised theory
energy-tensor τ<sup>α</sup><sub>σ</sub> associated with matter, which like the
energy components <i>t</i><sup>α</sup><sub>σ</sub> of the gravitation-field (equations
49, and 50) have a mixed character but which however can
be connected with symmetrical covariant tensors. The
equation (51) teaches us how to introduce the energy-tensor
(corresponding to the density of Poisson’s equation) in the
field equations of gravitation. If we consider a complete
system (for example the Solar-system) its total mass, as
also its total gravitating action, will depend on the total
energy of the system, ponderable as well as gravitational.
This can be expressed, by putting in (51), in place of
energy-components <i>t</i><sub>μ</sub><sup>σ</sup> of gravitation-field alone the sum
of the energy-components of matter and gravitation, <i>i.e.</i>,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>t</i><sub>μ</sub><sup>σ</sup> + T<sub>μ</sub><sup>σ</sup>.</div>

<p class='c010'>We thus get instead of (51), the tensor-equation</p>

<p class='c005'>where T = T<sub>μ</sub><sup>μ</sup> (Laue’s Scalar). These are the general field-equations

</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It must be admitted, that this introduction of the
energy-tensor of matter cannot be justified by means of the
Relativity-Postulate alone; for we have in the foregoing
analysis deduced it from the condition that the energy of
the gravitation-field should exert gravitating action in the
same way as every other kind of energy. The strongest
ground for the choice of the above equation however lies in
this, that they lead, as their consequences, to equations
expressing the conservation of the components of total
energy (the impulses and the energy) which exactly
correspond to the equations (49) and (49a). This shall be
shown afterwards.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>§17. The laws of conservation in the general case.</h4>
<p class='c004'>The equations (52) can be easily so transformed that

<p class='c010'>The expression arising out of the last member within

<p class='c010'>So that remembering (54) we have</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(55) ∂²/∂<i>x</i><sub>α</sub>∂<i>x</i><sub>σ</sub> (<i>g</i><sup>σβ</sup>Γ<sub>μβ</sub><sup>α</sup></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>identically.</p>

<p class='c005'>From (55) and (52a) it follows that</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

<p class='c010'>From the field equations of gravitation, it also follows
that the conservation-laws of impulse and energy are
satisfied. We see it most simply following the same
reasoning which lead to equations (49a); only instead of
the energy-components of the gravitational-field, we are to
introduce the total energy-components of matter and gravitational
field.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>§18. The Impulse-energy law for matter as a consequence of the field-equations.</h4>
<p class='c004'>If we multiply (53) with ∂<i>g</i><sup>μν</sup>/∂<i>x</i><sub>σ</sub>, we get in a way
similar to §15, remembering that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>g</i><sub>μν</sub> ∂<i>g</i><sup>μν</sup>/∂<i>x</i><sub>σ</sub> vanishes,</div>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(57) ∂T<sub>σ</sub><sup>α</sup>/∂<i>x</i><sub>α</sub> + ½ ∂<i>g</i><sup>μν</sup>/∂<i>x</i><sub>σ</sub> T<sub>μν</sub> = 0</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A comparison with (41b) shows that these equations
for the above choice of co-ordinates (√(-<i>g</i>) = 1) asserts
nothing but the vanishing of the divergence of the tensor
of the energy-components of matter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Physically the appearance of the second term on the
left-hand side shows that for matter alone the law of conservation
of impulse and energy cannot hold; or can only
hold when <i>g</i><sup>μν</sup>’s are constants; <i>i.e.</i>, when the field of gravitation
vanishes. The second member is an expression for
impulse and energy which the gravitation-field exerts per
time and per volume upon matter. This comes out clearer
when instead of (57) we write it in the form of (47).</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(57a) ∂T<sub>σ</sub><sup>α</sup>/∂<i>x</i><sub>α</sub> = -Γ<sub>σβ</sub><sup>α</sup> T<sub>α</sub><sup>β</sup>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The right-hand side expresses the interaction of the energy
of the gravitational-field on matter. The field-equations of
gravitation contain thus at the same time 4 conditions
which are to be satisfied by all material phenomena. We
get the equations of the material phenomena completely
when the latter is characterised by four other differential
equations independent of one another.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>D. THE “MATERIAL” PHENOMENA.</h3>
<p class='c004'>The Mathematical auxiliaries developed under ‘B’ at
once enables us to generalise, according to the generalised
theory of relativity, the physical laws of matter (Hydrodynamics,
Maxwell’s Electro-dynamics) as they lie already
formulated according to the special-relativity-theory.
The generalised Relativity Principle leads us to no further
limitation of possibilities; but it enables us to know
exactly the influence of gravitation on all processes without
the introduction of any new hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is owing to this, that as regards the physical nature
of matter (in a narrow sense) no definite necessary assumptions
are to be introduced. The question may lie open
whether the theories of the electro-magnetic field and the
gravitational-field together, will form a sufficient basis for
the theory of matter. The general relativity postulate can
teach us no new principle. But by building up the
theory it must be shown whether electro-magnetism and
gravitation together can achieve what the former alone
did not succeed in doing.</p>

already contained in (53), so that the latter only represents
(7) independent equations. This indefiniteness is due to
the wide freedom in the choice of co-ordinates, so that
mathematically the problem is indefinite in the sense that

<p class='c010'>On account of (30) the equation (66) becomes equivalent

the help of (61) and (64) we can easily show that the
energy-components of the electro-magnetic field, in the case
of the special relativity theory, give rise to the well-known
Maxwell-Poynting expressions.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have now deduced the most general laws which
the gravitation-field and matter satisfy when we use a
co-ordinate system for which √(-<i>g</i>) = 1. Thereby we
achieve an important simplification in all our formulas and
calculations, without renouncing the conditions of general
covariance, as we have obtained the equations through a
specialisation of the co-ordinate system from the general
covariant-equations. Still the question is not without formal
interest, whether, when the energy-components of the
gravitation-field and matter is defined in a generalised manner
without any specialisation of co-ordinates, the laws of conservation
have the form of the equation (56), and the field-equations
of gravitation hold in the form (52) or (52a);
such that on the left-hand side, we have a divergence in the
usual sense, and on the right-hand side, the sum of the
energy-components of matter and gravitation. I have
found out that this is indeed the case. But I am of opinion
that the communication of my rather comprehensive work
on this subject will not pay, for nothing essentially new
comes out of it.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>E. §21. Newton’s theory as a first approximation.</h3>
<p class='c004'>We have already mentioned several times that the
special relativity theory is to be looked upon as a special
case of the general, in which <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s have constant values (4).
This signifies, according to what has been said before, a
total neglect of the influence of gravitation. We get
one important approximation if we consider the case
when <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s differ from (4) only by small magnitudes (compared
to 1) where we can neglect small quantities of the
second and higher orders (first aspect of the approximation.)</p>

<p class='c005'>Further it should be assumed that within the space-time
region considered, <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s at infinite distances (using
the word infinite in a spatial sense) can, by a suitable choice
of co-ordinates, tend to the limiting values (4); <i>i.e.</i>, we consider
only those gravitational fields which can be regarded
as produced by masses distributed over finite regions.</p>

<p class='c005'>We can assume that this approximation should lead to
Newton’s theory. For it however, it is necessary to treat
the fundamental equations from another point of view.
Let us consider the motion of a particle according to the
equation (46). In the case of the special relativity theory,
the components</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>dx₁</i>/<i>ds</i>, <i>dx₂</i>/<i>ds</i>, <i>dx₃</i>/<i>ds</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>can take any values. This signifies that any velocity</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>v</i> = √((<i>dx₁</i>/<i>dx₄</i>)² + (<i>dx₂</i>/<i>dx₄</i>)² + (<i>dx₃</i>/<i>dx₄</i>)²)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>can appear which is less than the velocity of light in
vacuum (<i>v</i> &lt; 1). If we finally limit ourselves to the
consideration of the case when <i>v</i> is small compared to the
velocity of light, it signifies that the components</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>dx₁</i>/<i>ds</i>, <i>dx₂</i>/<i>ds</i>, <i>dx₃</i>/<i>ds</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>can be treated as small quantities, whereas <i>dx₄</i>/<i>ds</i> is equal to
1, up to the second-order magnitudes (the second point of
view for approximation).</p>

<p class='c005'>Now we see that, according to the first view of approximation,
the magnitudes γ<sub>μν</sub><sup>τ</sup>’s are all small quantities of
at least the first order. A glance at (46) will also show,
that in this equation according to the second view of
approximation, we are only to take into account those
terms for which μ = ν = 4.</p>

<p class='c005'>By limiting ourselves only to terms of the lowest order
we get instead of (46), first, the equations:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>d²</i><i>x</i><sub>τ</sub>/<i>dt²</i> = Γ₄₄<sup>τ</sup>, where <i>ds</i> = <i>dx₄</i> = <i>dt</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>or by limiting ourselves only to those terms which according
to the first stand-point are approximations of the first
order,</p>

<p class='c005'>It must be admitted, that this introduction of the
energy-tensor of matter cannot be justified by means of the
Relativity-Postulate alone; for we have in the foregoing
analysis deduced it from the condition that the energy of
the gravitation-field should exert gravitating action in the
same way as every other kind of energy. The strongest
ground for the choice of the above equation however lies in
this, that they lead, as their consequences, to equations
expressing the conservation of the components of total
energy (the impulses and the energy) which exactly
correspond to the equations (49) and (49a). This shall be
shown afterwards.</p>
<h4 class='c009'>§17. The laws of conservation in the general case.</h4>
<p class='c004'>The equations (52) can be easily so transformed that

<p class='c010'>A comparison with (41b) shows that these equations

nothing but the vanishing of the divergence of the tensor
of the energy-components of matter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Physically the appearance of the second term on the
left-hand side shows that for matter alone the law of conservation
of impulse and energy cannot hold; or can only
hold when <i>g</i><sup>μν</sup>’s are constants; <i>i.e.</i>, when the field of gravitation
vanishes. The second member is an expression for
impulse and energy which the gravitation-field exerts per
time and per volume upon matter. This comes out clearer

<h3 class='c008'>D. THE “MATERIAL” PHENOMENA.</h3>
<p class='c004'>The Mathematical auxiliaries developed under ‘B’ at
once enables us to generalise, according to the generalised
theory of relativity, the physical laws of matter (Hydrodynamics,
Maxwell’s Electro-dynamics) as they lie already
formulated according to the special-relativity-theory.
The generalised Relativity Principle leads us to no further
limitation of possibilities; but it enables us to know
exactly the influence of gravitation on all processes without
the introduction of any new hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is owing to this, that as regards the physical nature
of matter (in a narrow sense) no definite necessary assumptions
are to be introduced. The question may lie open
whether the theories of the electro-magnetic field and the
gravitational-field together, will form a sufficient basis for
the theory of matter. The general relativity postulate can
teach us no new principle. But by building up the
theory it must be shown whether electro-magnetism and
gravitation together can achieve what the former alone
did not succeed in doing.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have now deduced the most general laws which
the gravitation-field and matter satisfy when we use a
co-ordinate system for which √(-<i>g</i>) = 1. Thereby we
achieve an important simplification in all our formulas and
calculations, without renouncing the conditions of general
covariance, as we have obtained the equations through a
specialisation of the co-ordinate system from the general
covariant-equations. Still the question is not without formal
interest, whether, when the energy-components of the
gravitation-field and matter is defined in a generalised manner
without any specialisation of co-ordinates, the laws of conservation
have the form of the equation (56), and the field-equations
of gravitation hold in the form (52) or (52a);
such that on the left-hand side, we have a divergence in the
usual sense, and on the right-hand side, the sum of the
energy-components of matter and gravitation. I have
found out that this is indeed the case. But I am of opinion
that the communication of my rather comprehensive work
on this subject will not pay, for nothing essentially new
comes out of it.</p>
<h3 class='c008'>E. §21. Newton’s theory as a first approximation.</h3>
<p class='c004'>We have already mentioned several times that the
special relativity theory is to be looked upon as a special
case of the general, in which <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s have constant values (4).
This signifies, according to what has been said before, a
total neglect of the influence of gravitation. We get
one important approximation if we consider the case
when <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s differ from (4) only by small magnitudes (compared
to 1) where we can neglect small quantities of the
second and higher orders (first aspect of the approximation.)</p>

<p class='c005'>Further it should be assumed that within the space-time
region considered, <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s at infinite distances (using
the word infinite in a spatial sense) can, by a suitable choice
of co-ordinates, tend to the limiting values (4); <i>i.e.</i>, we consider
only those gravitational fields which can be regarded
as produced by masses distributed over finite regions.</p>

<p class='c005'>We can assume that this approximation should lead to
Newton’s theory. For it however, it is necessary to treat
the fundamental equations from another point of view.
Let us consider the motion of a particle according to the
equation (46). In the case of the special relativity theory,
the components</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>dx₁</i>/<i>ds</i>, <i>dx₂</i>/<i>ds</i>, <i>dx₃</i>/<i>ds</i>,</div>
    </div>

<p class='c010'>can take any values. This signifies that any velocity</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>v</i> = √((<i>dx₁</i>/<i>dx₄</i>)² + (<i>dx₂</i>/<i>dx₄</i>)² + (<i>dx₃</i>/<i>dx₄</i>)²)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>can appear which is less than the velocity of light in
vacuum (<i>v</i> &lt; 1). If we finally limit ourselves to the
consideration of the case when <i>v</i> is small compared to the
velocity of light, it signifies that the components</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>dx₁</i>/<i>ds</i>, <i>dx₂</i>/<i>ds</i>, <i>dx₃</i>/<i>ds</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>can be treated as small quantities, whereas <i>dx₄</i>/<i>ds</i> is equal to
1, up to the second-order magnitudes (the second point of
view for approximation).</p>

<p class='c005'>Now we see that, according to the first view of approximation,
the magnitudes γ<sub>μν</sub><sup>τ</sup>’s are all small quantities of
at least the first order. A glance at (46) will also show,
that in this equation according to the second view of
approximation, we are only to take into account those
terms for which μ = ν = 4.</p>

<p class='c005'>By limiting ourselves only to terms of the lowest order
we get instead of (46), first, the equations:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>d²</i><i>x</i><sub>τ</sub>/<i>dt²</i> = Γ₄₄<sup>τ</sup>, where <i>ds</i> = <i>dx₄</i> = <i>dt</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>or by limiting ourselves only to those terms which according
to the first stand-point are approximations of the first
order,</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/form-120.png' alt='Formula.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>If we further assume that the gravitation-field is
quasi-static, <i>i.e.</i>, it is limited only to the case when the
matter producing the gravitation-field is moving slowly
(relative to the velocity of light) we can neglect the
differentiations of the positional co-ordinates on the right-hand
side with respect to time, so that we get</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(67) <i>d²</i><i>x</i><sub>τ</sub>/<i>dt²</i> = -½ ∂<i>g₄₄</i>/∂<i>x</i><sub>τ</sub> (τ, = 1, 2, 3)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This is the equation of motion of a material point
according to Newton’s theory, where <i>g</i>₄₄/₂ plays the part of
gravitational potential. The remarkable thing in the
result is that in the first-approximation of motion of the
material point, only the component <i>g₄₄</i> of the fundamental
tensor appears.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us now turn to the field-equation (53). In this
case, we have to remember that the energy-tensor of
matter is exclusively defined in a narrow sense by the
density ρ of matter, <i>i.e.</i>, by the second member on the
right-hand side of 58 [(58a, or 58b)]. If we make the
necessary approximations, then all component vanish
except</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>τ₄₄ = ρ = τ.</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>On the left-hand side of (53) the second term is an
infinitesimal of the second order, so that the first leads to

<p class='c004'>In order to obtain Newton’s theory as a first approximation
we had to calculate only <i>g₄₄</i>, out of the 10 components
<i>g</i><sub>μν</sub> of the gravitation-potential, for that is the only
component which comes in the first approximate equations
of motion of a material point in a gravitational field.</p>

<p class='c005'>We see however, that the other components of <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>
should also differ from the values given in (4) as required by
the condition <i>g</i> = -1.</p>

<p class='c005'>For a heavy particle at the origin of co-ordinates and

</div>

<p class='c010'>where M denotes the mass generating the field. It is easy
to verify that this solution satisfies approximately the
field-equation outside the mass M.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us now investigate the influences which the field
of mass M will have upon the metrical properties of the
field. Between the lengths and times measured locally on
the one hand, and the differences in co-ordinates <i>dx</i><sub>ν</sub> on the
other, we have the relation</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>ds²</i> = <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub> <i>dx</i><sub>μ</sub> <i>dx</i><sub>ν</sub>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>For a unit measuring rod, for example, placed parallel to
the <i>x</i> axis, we have to put</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>ds²</i> = -1, <i>dx₂</i> = <i>dx₃</i> = <i>dx₄</i> = 0</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>then          -1 = <i>g</i>₁₁<i>dx₁²</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>If the unit measuring rod lies on the <i>x</i> axis, the first of
the equations (70) gives</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>g₁₁</i> = -(1 + α/<i>r</i>).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>From both these relations it follows as a first approximation
that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(71) <i>dx</i> = 1 - α/2<i>r</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The unit measuring rod appears, when referred to the
co-ordinate-system, shortened by the calculated magnitude
through the presence of the gravitational field, when we
place it radially in the field.</p>

<p class='c005'>Similarly we can get its co-ordinate-length in a
tangential position, if we put for example</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>ds²</i> = -1, <i>dx₁</i> = <i>dx₃</i> = <i>dx₄</i> = 0, <i>x₁</i> = <i>r</i>, <i>x₂</i> = <i>x₃</i> = 0</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>we then get</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(71a) -1 = <i>g₂₂</i> <i>dx₂²</i> = -<i>dx₂²</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The gravitational field has no influence upon the length
of the rod, when we put it tangentially in the field.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus Euclidean geometry does not hold in the gravitational
field even in the first approximation, if we conceive
that one and the same rod independent of its position and
its orientation can serve as the measure of the same
extension. But a glance at (70a) and (69) shows that the
expected difference is much too small to be noticeable
in the measurement of earth’s surface.</p>

<p class='c005'>We would further investigate the rate of going of a
unit-clock which is placed in a statical gravitational field.
Here we have for a period of the clock</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>ds</i> = 1, <i>dx₁</i> = <i>dx₂</i> <i>dx₃</i> = 0;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>then we have</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 = <i>g₄₄</i><i>dx₄²</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>dx₄</i> = 1/√(<i>g</i>₄₄) = 1/√(1 + (<i>g</i>₄₄ - 1)) = 1 - (<i>g</i>₄₄ - 1)/2</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>or <i>dx₄</i> = 1 + <i>k</i>/8π ∫ ρ<i>d</i>τ/<i>r</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Therefore the clock goes slowly what it is placed in
the neighbourhood of ponderable masses. It follows from
this that the spectral lines in the light coming to us from
the surfaces of big stars should appear shifted towards the
red end of the spectrum.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us further investigate the path of light-rays in a
statical gravitational field. According to the special relativity
theory, the velocity of light is given by the equation</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>-<i>dx₁²</i> - <i>dx₂²</i> - <i>dx₃²</i> + <i>dx₄²</i> = 0;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>thus also according to the generalised relativity theory it
is given by the equation</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(73) <i>ds²</i> = <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub> <i>dx</i><sub>μ</sub> <i>dx</i><sub>ν</sub> = 0.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>If the direction, <i>i.e.</i>, the ratio <i>dx₁</i> : <i>dx₂</i> : <i>dx₃</i> is given,
the equation (73) gives the magnitudes</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>dx₁</i>/<i>dx₄</i>, <i>dx₂</i>/<i>dx₄</i>, <i>dx₃</i>/<i>dx₄</i>,</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>√((<i>dx₁</i>/<i>dx₄</i>)² + (<i>dx₂</i>/<i>dx₄</i>)² + (<i>dx₃</i>/<i>dx₄</i>)²) = γ,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>in the sense of the Euclidean Geometry. We can easily see
that, with reference to the co-ordinate system, the rays of
light must appear curved in case <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s are not constants.
If <i>n</i> be the direction perpendicular to the direction
of propagation, we have, from Huygen’s principle, that
light-rays (taken in the plane (γ, <i>n</i>)] must suffer a
curvature ∂λ/∂<i>n</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us find out the curvature which a light-ray suffers
when it goes by a mass M at a distance Δ from it. If we
use the co-ordinate system according to the above scheme,
then the total bending B of light-rays (reckoned positive
when it is concave to the origin) is given as a sufficient
approximation by</p>

      <div class='line'>B = ∫<sub>-∞</sub><sup>∞</sup> ∂γ/∂[<i>x</i>]₁ <i>dx₂</i></div>

<p class='c010'>where (73) and (70) gives</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>γ = √(-<i>g₄₄</i>/<i>g₂₂</i>) = 1 - α/2<i>r</i> (1 + <i>x₂²</i>/<i>r²</i>).</div>

<p class='c010'>A ray of light just grazing the sun would suffer a bending

<p class='c010'>making Fresnelian convection co-efficient simply unity.</p>

<p class='c005'>Equations (1·21) and (2·21) may be obtained more
simply from physical considerations.</p>

<p class='c005'>According to Heaviside and Hertz, the real seat of
both electric and magnetic polarisation is the moving
medium itself. Now at a point which is fixed with respect
to the ether, the rate of change of electric polarisation is
δD/δ<i>t</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Consider a slab of matter moving with velocity <i>u</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>
along the <i>x</i>-axis, then even in a stationary field of
electrostatic polarisation, that is, for a field in which
δD/δ<i>t</i> = 0, there will be some change in the polarisation of
the body due to its motion, given by <i>u</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>(δD/δ<i>x</i>). Hence we
must add this term to a purely temporal rate of change
δD/δ<i>t</i>. Doing this we immediately arrive at equations
(1·21) and (2·21) for the special case considered there.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus the Hertz-Heaviside form of field equations gives
<i>unity</i> as the value for the Fresnelian convection co-efficient.
It has been shown in the historical introduction how this
is entirely at variance with the observed optical facts. As
a matter of fact, Larmor has shown (Aether and Matter)
that 1 - 1/μ² is not only sufficient but is also necessary, in
order to explain experiments of the Arago prism type.</p>

<p class='c005'>A short summary of the electromagnetic experiments
bearing on this question, has already been given in the
introduction.</p>

<p class='c005'>According to Hertz and Heaviside the total polarisation
is situated in the medium itself and is completely
carried away by it. Thus the electromagnetic effect
outside a moving medium should be proportional to K, the
specific inductive capacity.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Rowland</i> showed in 1876 that when a charged condenser
is rapidly rotated (the dielectric remaining stationary),
the magnetic effect outside is proportional to K, the Sp.
Ind. Cap.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Röntgen</i> (Annalen der Physik 1888, 1890) found that
if the dielectric is rotated while the condenser remains
stationary, the effect is proportional to K - 1.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Eichenwald</i> (Annalen der Physik 1903, 1904) rotated
together both condenser and dielectric and found that the
magnetic effect was proportional to the potential difference
and to the angular velocity, but was completely independent
of K. This is of course quite consistent with Rowland
and Röntgen.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Blondlot</i> (Comptes Rendus, 1901) passed a current
of air in a steady magnetic field H<sub><i>y</i></sub>, (H = H<sub><i>z</i></sub> = 0). If
this current of air moves with velocity <i>u</i><sub><i>x</i></sub> along the
<i>x</i>-axis, an electromotive force would be set up along the
<i>z</i>-axis, due to the relative motion of matter and magnetic
tubes of induction. A pair of plates at <i>z</i> = ±<i>a</i>, will be
charged up with density ρ = D<sub><i>z</i></sub> = KE = K. <i>u</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> H<sub><i>y</i></sub>/c.
But Blondlot failed to detect any such effect.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>H. A. Wilson</i> (Phil. Trans. Royal Soc. 1904) repeated
the experiment with a cylindrical condenser made of
ebony, rotating in a magnetic field parallel to its own
axis. He observed a change proportional to K — 1 and
not to K.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus the above set of electro-magnetic experiments
contradict the Hertz-Heaviside equations, and these must
be abandoned.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the help of the above set of equations, which is
known as the Lorentz transformation, he succeeded in
showing how the Fitzgerald contraction results as a
consequence of “fortuitous compensation of opposing
effects.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It should be observed that the Lorentz transformation
is not identical with the Einstein transformation. The
Einsteinian addition of velocities is quite different as
also the expression for the “relative” density of electricity.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is true that the Maxwell-Lorentz field equations
remain <i>practically</i> unchanged by the Lorentz transformation,
but they <i>are</i> changed to some slight extent. One
marked advantage of the Einstein transformation consists
in the fact that the field equations of a moving system
preserve <i>exactly</i> the same form as those of a stationary
system.</p>

<p class='c005'>It should also be noted that the Fresnelian convection
coefficient comes out in the theory of relativity as a direct
consequence of Einstein’s addition of velocities and is
quite independent of any electrical theory of matter.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lorentz showed that the Maxwell-Lorentz system
of electromagnetic field-equations remained practically
unchanged by the Lorentz transformation. Thus the
electromagnetic laws of Maxwell and Lorentz <i>can be
definitely proved</i> “to be independent of the manner in
which they are referred to two coordinate systems which
have a uniform translatory motion relative to each other.”
(See “Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,” page 5.) Thus
so far as the electromagnetic laws are concerned, the
principle of relativity <i>can be proved to be true</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>But it is not known whether this principle will remain
true in the case of other physical laws. We can always
proceed on the assumption that it does remain true. Thus
it is always possible to construct physical laws in such a
way that they retain their form when referred to moving
coordinates. The ultimate ground for formulating physical
laws in this way is merely a subjective conviction that
the principle of relativity is universally true. There is
no <i>a priori</i> logical necessity that it should be so. Hence
the Principle of Relativity (so far as it is applied to
phenomena other than electromagnetic) must be regarded
as a <i>postulate</i>, which we have assumed to be true, but for
which we cannot adduce any definite proof, until after
the generalisation is made and its consequences tested in
the light of actual experience.</p>

<h3 id='note-9' class='c008'>Note 9. <br />On the Constancy of the Velocity of Light.</h3>
<p class='c004'>Page 12—refer also to page 6, of Einstein’s paper.</p>

<p class='c005'>One of the two fundamental Postulates of the Principle
of Relativity is that the velocity of light should remain
constant whether the source is moving or stationary. It
follows that even if a radiant source S move with a velocity
<i>u</i>, it should always remain the centre of spherical waves
expanding outwards with velocity <i>c</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>At first sight, it may not appear clear why the
velocity should remain constant. Indeed according to the
theory of Ritz, the velocity should become <i>c</i> + <i>u</i>, when the
source of light moves towards the observer with the
velocity <i>u</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Prof. de Sitter has given an astronomical argument for
deciding between these two divergent views. Let us
suppose there is a double star of which one is revolving
about the common centre of gravity in a circular orbit.
Let the observer be in the plane of the orbit, at a great
distance Δ.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/fig02.png' alt='Experiment.' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>The light emitted by the star when at the position A
will be received by the observer after a time, Δ/(<i>c</i> + <i>u</i>) while
the light emitted by the star when at the position B will
be received after a time Δ/(<i>c</i> - <i>u</i>). Let T be the real half-period
of the star. Then the observed half-period from
B to A is approximately T - 2Δ<i>u</i>/<i>c²</i> and from A to B is
T + 2Δ<i>u</i>/<i>c²</i>. Now if 2<i>u</i>Δ/<i>c²</i> be comparable to T, then it
is impossible that the observations should satisfy
Kepler’s Law. In most of the spectroscopic binary stars,
2<i>u</i>Δ/<i>c²</i> are not only of the same order as T, but are mostly
much larger. For example, if <i>u</i> = 100 <i>km</i>/sec, T = 8 days,
Δ/<i>c</i> = 33 years (corresponding to an annual parallax of ·1″),
then T - 2<i>u</i>Δ/<i>c²</i>  = 0. The existence of the Spectroscopic
binaries, and the fact that they follow Kepler’s Law is
therefore a proof that <i>c</i> is not affected by the motion of
the source.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a later memoir, replying to the criticisms of
Freundlich and Günthick that an apparent eccentricity
occurs in the motion proportional to <i>ku</i>Δ₀, <i>u₀</i> being the
maximum value of <i>u</i>, the velocity of light emitted being</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Prof. de Sitter admits the validity of the criticisms. But
he remarks that an upper value of <i>k</i> may be calculated from
the observations of the double star β-Aurigae. For this star,
the parallax π = ·014″, <i>e</i> = ·005, <i>u₀</i> = 110 <i>km</i>/sec, T = 3·96,</p>

<p class='c005'>[P. C. M.]</p>
<h3 class='c008'>Note 11 <br /> (page 17) <br /> Space-time vectors of the first and the second kind.</h3>
<p class='c004'>As we had already occasion to mention, Sommerfeld
has, in two papers on four dimensional geometry (<i>vide</i>,
Annalen der Physik, Bd. 32, p. 749; and Bd. 33, p. 649),
translated the ideas of Minkowski into the language of four
dimensional geometry. Instead of Minkowski’s space-time
vector of the first kind, he uses the more expressive term
‘four-vector,’ thereby making it quite clear that it
represents a directed quantity like a straight line, a force
or a momentum, and has got 4 components, three in the
direction of space-axes, and one in the direction of the
time-axis.</p>

<p class='c005'>The representation of the plane (defined by two straight
lines) is much more difficult. In three dimensions, the
plane can be represented by the vector perpendicular to
itself. But that artifice is not available in four dimensions.
For the perpendicular to a plane, we now have not a single
line, but an infinite number of lines constituting a plane.
This difficulty has been overcome by Minkowski in a very
elegant manner which will become clear later on.
Meanwhile we offer the following extract from the
above mentioned work of Sommerfeld.</p>

<p class='c005'>(Pp. 755, Bd. 32, Ann. d. Physik.)</p>

<p class='c005'>“In order to have a better knowledge about the nature
of the six-vector (which is the same thing as Minkowski’s
space-time vector of the <i>2nd</i> kind) let us take the special
case of a piece of plane, having unit area (contents), and
the form of a parallelogram, bounded by the four-vectors
<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, passing through the origin. Then the projection of
this piece of plane on the <i>xy</i> plane is given by the
projections <i>u</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>, <i>u</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>, <i>v</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>, <i>v</i><sub><i>y</i></sub> of the four vectors in the
combination</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Let us form in a similar manner all the six components of
this plane φ. Then six components are not all independent
but are connected by the following relation</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>φ<sub><i>y</i> <i>z</i></sub> φ<sub><i>x</i> <i>l</i></sub> + φ<sub><i>z</i> <i>x</i></sub> φ<sub><i>y</i> <i>l</i></sub> + φ<sub><i>x</i> <i>y</i></sub> φ<sub><i>z</i> <i>l</i></sub> = 0</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Further the contents | φ | of the piece of a plane is to
be defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of
these six quantities. In fact,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Let us now on the other hand take the case of the unit
plane φ<sup>*</sup> normal to φ; we can call this plane the
Complement of φ. Then we have the following relations
between the components of the two plane:—</p>

given by W′ = (W - <i>v</i>)/(1 - W<i>v</i>/<i>c²</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus “time” from A to B as measured in S′, is given
by <i>l</i>/W′ = <i>l</i>(1 - W<i>v</i>/<i>c²</i>)/(W - <i>v</i>) = <i>t′</i>      (1)</p>

<p class='c005'>Now if <i>v</i> is less than <i>c</i>, then W being greater than <i>c</i>
(by hypothesis) W is greater than <i>v</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, W > <i>v</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let W = <i>c</i> + μ and <i>v</i> = <i>c</i> - λ.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then W<i>v</i> = (<i>c</i> + μ)(<i>c</i> - λ) = <i>c²</i> + (μ + λ)<i>c</i> - μλ.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now we can always choose <i>v</i> in such a way that W<i>v</i> is
greater than <i>c²</i>, since W<i>v</i> is > <i>c²</i> if (μ + λ)<i>c</i> - μλ is > 0,
that is, if μ + λ > μλ/<i>c</i>; which can always be satisfied by
a suitable choice of λ.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus for W > <i>c</i> we can always choose λ in such a
way as to make W<i>v</i> > <i>c²</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, λ - W<i>v</i>/<i>c²</i> negative. But
W - <i>v</i> is always positive. Hence with W > <i>c</i>, we can
always make <i>t′</i>, the time from A to B in equation (1)
“negative.” That is, the signal starting from A will reach
B (as observed in system S′) in less than no time. Thus the
effect will be perceived before the cause commences to act,
<i>i.e.</i>, the future will precede the past. Which is absurd.
Hence we conclude that W > <i>c</i> is an impossibility, there
can be no velocity greater than that of light.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is <i>conceptually</i> possible to imagine velocities greater
than that of light, but such velocities cannot occur in
reality. Velocities greater than <i>c</i>, will not produce
any effect. Causal effect of any physical type can never
travel with a velocity greater than that of light.</p>

<h3 id='note-15' class='c008'>Note 15. <br />The vector product (<i>w</i><i>f</i>). (P. 36).</h3>
<p class='c004'>This represents the vector product of a four-vector and
a six-vector. Now as combinations of this type are of
frequent occurrence in this paper, it will be better to form
an idea of their geometrical meaning. The following
is taken from the above mentioned paper of Sommerfeld.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We can also form a vectorial combination of a four-vector
and a six-vector, giving us a vector of the third
type. If the six-vector be of a special type, <i>i.e.</i>, a piece
of plane, then this vector of the third type denotes the
parallelopiped formed of this four-vector and the complement
of this piece of plane. In the general case, the
product will be the geometric sum of two parallelopipeds,
but it can always be represented by a four-vector of the
1st type. For two pieces of 3-space volumes can always
be added together by the vectorial addition of their components.
So by the addition of two 3-space volumes,
we do not obtain a vector of a more general type, but
one which can always be represented by a four-vector
(loc. cit. p. 759). The state of affairs here is the same as
in the ordinary vector calculus, where by the vector-multiplication
of a vector of the first, and a vector of the
second type (<i>i.e.</i>, a polar vector), we obtain a vector of the
first type (axial vector). The formal scheme of this
multiplication is taken from the three-dimensional case.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let A = (A<sub><i>x</i></sub>, A<sub><i>y</i></sub>, A<sub><i>z</i></sub>) denote a vector of the first
type, B = (B<sub><i>y z</i></sub>, B<sub><i>z x</i></sub>, B<sub><i>x y</i></sub>) denote a vector of the second
type. From this last, let us form three special vectors of
the first kind, namely—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>B<sub><i>x</i></sub> = (B<sub><i>x x</i></sub>, B<sub><i>x y</i></sub>, B<sub><i>x z</i></sub>) }</div>
      <div class='line'>B<sub><i>y</i></sub> = (B<sub><i>y x</i></sub>, B<sub><i>y y</i></sub>, B<sub><i>y z</i></sub>) } (B<sub><i>i k</i></sub> = - B<sub><i>k i</i></sub>, B<sub><i>i i</i></sub> = 0).</div>
      <div class='line'>B<sub><i>z</i></sub> = (B<sub><i>z x</i></sub>, B<sub><i>z y</i></sub>, B<sub><i>z z</i></sub>) }</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Since B<sub><i>j j</i></sub> is zero, B<sub><i>j</i></sub> is perpendicular to the <i>j</i>-axis.
The <i>j</i>-component of the vector-product of A and B is
equivalent to the scalar product of A and B<sub><i>j</i></sub>, <i>i.e.</i>,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(A B<sub><i>j</i></sub>,) = A<sub><i>x</i></sub> B<sub><i>j x</i></sub> + A<sub><i>y</i></sub> B<sub><i>j y</i></sub> + A<sub><i>z</i></sub> B<sub><i>j z</i></sub>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>We see easily that this coincides with the usual rule
for the vector-product; <i>e. g.</i>, for <i>j</i> = <i>x</i>.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Correspondingly let us define in the four-dimensional
case the product (P<i>f</i>) of any four-vector P and the six-vector
<i>f</i>. The <i>j</i>-component (<i>j</i> = <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, or <i>l</i>) is given by</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(P<i>f</i><sub><i>j</i></sub>) = P<sub><i>x</i></sub><i>f</i><sub><i>j</i> <i>x</i></sub> + P<sub><i>y</i></sub><i>f</i><sub><i>j</i> <i>y</i></sub> + P<sub><i>w</i></sub><i>f</i><sub><i>j</i> <i>z</i></sub> + P<sub><i>z</i></sub><i>f</i><sub><i>j</i> <i>l</i></sub></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Each one of these components is obtained as the scalar
product of P, and the vector <i>f</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> which is perpendicular to
j-axis, and is obtained from <i>f</i> by the rule <i>f</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> = [(<i>f</i><sub><i>j</i> <i>x</i></sub>, <i>f</i><sub><i>j</i> <i>y</i></sub>,
<i>f</i><sub><i>j</i> <i>z</i></sub>, <i>f</i><sub><i>j</i> <i>l</i></sub>) <i>f</i><sub><i>j</i> <i>j</i></sub> = 0.]</p>

<p class='c005'>We can also find out here the geometrical significance
of vectors of the third type, when <i>f</i> = φ, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>f</i> represents
only one plane.</p>

<p class='c005'>We replace φ by the parallelogram defined by the two

the discoverer of the theorem of relativity. Later writers
have sometimes used the symbol □ to denote this

become clear when along with Minkowski’s method of

to see that lor S will be a four-vector. Let us find
the component of this four-vector in any direction <i>s</i>.
Let S denote the three-space which passes through the

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
